1," Perfect type cover I find it very comfortable to type with it but i rarely use the fingerprint ID Keyboard very smooth. I really like the fingerprint ID makes logging in very easy and fast. The key on the keyboard are very smooth. Perfect It's a good keyboard. I like the fingerprint reader; its fast and accurate. It's a keyboard I haven't encountered much wrong with it, but occasionally the touch pad is a little too sensitive. Major improvement over previous type keyboard Trackpad is a vast improvement over surface 3 type keyboard. Keypad is also vastly improved. Much Better This was an upgrade from my current Surface 2 Pro. The difference is obvious, the keys feel great and responsive. A bit expensive but the surface is not cheap either. Highly recommend it. Almost perfect keyboard Would have given it 5 stars if I could figure out how to adjust the mouse pad sensitivity. It may take an update from Microsoft, hopefully it'll come soon. I have gotten used to it so its not that big of a deal anymore Awesome keyboard Pretty nice keyboard quick responsive fingerprint reader. Should've been included since the beginning. A necessary accessory If you buy a Surface Pro 4, you need this. It makes it much better, since the touchscreen keyboard is not really that good. It's not quite like having a laptop, but at least you have a physical keyboard. needed for surface pro 4 keypad works great. the fingerprint sensor sometimes has trouble picking up my fingerprint. The fingerprint ID is worth the extra! I did not realize that the Surface uses the camera as a means of identification to log in, otherwise I wouldn't have gotten the keyboard with the fingerprint ID. However, there have been several times where the camera has taken a moment or two to figure out what's going on, or didn't turn on for some reason, so I was able to get logged into the Surface quickly by utilizing the Fingerprint ID. Every time that I've used it, it has worked quickly and easily. Responsive Small Keyboard Sturdy and small perfect for travelling and the fingerprint ID is very responsive. Highly recommended. First one broke My first keyboard broke in about 2 months. I did extensive testing on it and determined that it was a hardware failure (the trackpad was the only thing not working). Best Buy was great. They returned the keyboard even though I didn't have a warranty. This was a special case though so I wouldn't expect it. Get that warranty, you may need it. The second one works great btw. No issues at all. -1 star for the first one breaking. Excellent, responsive keyboard The finger print scanner works great and is quick to recognize you . Keyboard very responsive and being back lit is awesome and it's very bright Convenient I bought it for convenience but it so smooth that i love it! A little pricey but very handy If you have a strong password, the fingerprint reader makes logging on much easier. Perfect keyboard for my surface Solid feel with good key spacing-backlit keys a nice plus. I use the fingerprint reader to quickly log onto either of two accounts using different fingers. Great product! Great keyboard! I had thought the fingerprint scanner would be somewhat of a gimmick, but I use it every time I log into my Surface Pro 3. The backlit keyboard is also a great feature. A must have for your suface pro! ID works well So I got a new surface 4 and it'd be crazy not to have a keyboard. The keys are springy, but they are a bit click-y so don't think you're going to type like a ninja. I was bummed it only came in black with the fingerprint ID but it works well so it was worth the trade off. decent keyboard it works great. the best part is the biometric scanner. Not absolutely necessary The SP4 keyboard is largely improved and the clickiness of the keys is definitely something I appreciate. Overall, a great typing experience- keys are well lit and spaced for comfortable typing. While the fingerprint reader does add an extra layer of security and ""future-proofness"", it doesn't otherwise add large improvements. Windows 10 has facial login that you'll likely use more often than this. But having the finger print reader can be handy. If the extra few bucks doesn't matter to you, why not? Keyboard Keyboard was great and love the finger print scanner.. A must have for Surface owners Keyboard fits perfectly. It attaches magnetically to the Surface and works as a cover for the screen. Very good quality. Keys feel good to the touch. Touchpad is great. Your Surface basically becomes a laptop when the keyboard is attached. This one has the fingerprint reader which works seamlessly with Windows Hello to log you in. Didn't like using the camera to log in because it insists on logging you in continuously and sometimes it logged me in and I wasn't even looking at the camera. The fingerprint reader works much better. Great Quality Great for professional business environment, only wish it could pop out for use as tablet only. Love it! I love the new keyboard! I especially like that it fits my Surface Pro 3. I also love the finger print scanner!!!! Not a dishwasher! This is a keyboard that will not wash your dishes, moisturizer your skin, or fertilize your lawn. It's a keyboard and it has a nicer feel than the original. The fingerprint reader works very well. It can also be used as a trivet for a hot roasting pan.... Once.. Great keyboard! Love this keyboard and fingerprint scanner is a must have! Easy to type and my Surface Pro looks great just like having a paper notebook. The keyboard is perfect meets my need. The fingerprint works perfect, set up is so easy. I had a surface without a key board it was difficult typing whole page world document as in number of occasion I had to minimize the keyboard. With this one and its flexibility in positioning, everything works perfect. Awesome keyboard I got a Surface Pro 3 bundle with a keyboard and pen. I purchased both the Surface Pro 4 keyboard and the new pen with the 4 tips. The keyboard with the fingerprint reader is very convenient and the touch and feel of the keys are superior to the bundled keyboard. Must have! Fingerprint scanner is handy and the board itself protects the screen well. Nice design Nice design. It is a nice cover and you can open it or even flip it the other way for a keyboard. Fantastic Nice keyboard. Find the fingerprint scanner useful Nice keyboard Nice keyboard for surface tablet that can be implemented as needed. This is a must-have accessory! I love the way MS Surface uses a magnetic connection point for its keyboard. I also am extremely glad I purchased the one with the fingerprint login. It makes logging in a snap! AND..the keyboard doubles as a tablet cover. Great keyboard I like the fingerprint scan . The option was not built into the surface. Keyboard . Feels like it is well made. I like this keyboard exceptional keyboard I think it looks nice works nice and acts as a non skid pad when using as a tablet, protects the screen as well Must have for Surface Pro users Really nice keyboard, well worth the money. Feels just like an laptop keyboard, and the fingerprint scanner works great. Minimal effort to setup. Very comfortable Light weight easy to use and doubles as a case. Easy to take on and off. Great keyboard for my tablet Goes very well with my Microsoft tablet and it has all the fetures I need. Great compaion for Surface Pro 4 The type cover works great with the Surface Pro 4. Convenience of the fingerprint scanner is worth the extra cost. Poor Fingerprint Scanner instructions Could not get the very feature I purchase the keyboard cover to work on a Surface Pro 3. Great Keyboard This is a great keyboard and makes the Surface Pro 4 the right choice to switrhc from my mac without missing my mac. Great keyboard Perfect keyboard for the surface pro. I definitely recommend this Love it! I just can't say how surprised i was with the feel/response of the keyboard. Way beyond my expectations!! Windows update really helped I really like the feel of this keyboard, nice to type on and crazy thin.When I first got this keyboard windows wasn't great at reading the finger print, if you didn't place the same part of you finger on the pad each time it wouldn't work. Now they take a couple different parts of the finger and it works much better. Works Perfectly I love this external keyboard. This turns the Surface Pro into a laptop. I only wish the material it is made from were easier to clean. Microsoft - Surface Pro Type Cover w/ Fingerprint Purchased this to go with the new Microsoft - Surface Pro 4 - 12.3 - 512GB - Intel Core i7 - Silver we purchased. Great product I bought a smaller spec'ed surface pro for meetings and am glad I bought there keyboard with finger print scanner. It works great, and has a great feel. The best!!! This keyboard is awsome. I find it very easy to type on, and prefer it to my pc's keyboard. If anything happens to this keyboard, I will buy another one, without thinking about it. The best! Great keyboard Easy to use and able to act as a regular keyboard. Finger print not worth the extra Excellent product overall. One of the best type covers I have purchased that being said I would recommend not paying extra for the fingerprint scanner. Great keyboard. It just snaps on I love how it snaps into place. Easy to use. Only needs a light touch. Great for school Much better than a laptop.So easy to do my online class work. Would recommend for students. Must have The keyboard works perfectly with the surface pro and is a must have if you type often. Love it When I'm bouncing around on a plane the finger print reader makes things even easier Biometric KB For just a few dollars more, you can use a finger swipe to login. Nice feature. Worth the money. Only comes in black though. Nice and light Not too big but works great . Love fingerprint control Nice feel I was surprised at how nice this keyboard works and feels. Must have with surface pro This is a necessity to have with your surface pro. It's just a shame that this is not included with the pro. works perfectly great add on for the surface pro! the bio logon feature works great! Great feel, intermittent fingerprint reader The feel of the keys and touch pad is considerably better than the earlier version, but half the time fingerprint reader doesn't recognize my finger is on the sensor. I trust this will get resolved with a patch. Great Keyboard Love the new finger scan. Great feel and ease of use. Keyboard with fingerprinter Took a little getting used to the cramped keyboard, but I love the log in options. Great keyboard Love the fingerprint touch access Great Keyboard! Like the review below mine, I purchased this specific type cover purely for its appearance, but I am glad I did. It looks amazing with my SP4 and works well too. It is backlit, which is my preference for keyboards, and is also fairly sturdy considering how thin and light it is. Typing on it is just like typing on a real laptop keyboard, which I like a lot. I am sure the other type covers are the same, but as I said, this one had the look I wanted and I didn't mind spending the extra money for it. A HUGE Improvement I have a Surface Pro 3 and have loved using it, but the type cover always felt a little less than functional to me. It worked, but I always preferred typing on a full laptop or computer printer if it were anything more than a quick paragraph. Don't even get me started on the tracpad! It was too small and nowhere near sensitive enough. No more! This keyboard feels as good as one on a quality laptop would and it's a joy to type on it. The tracpad isn't even in the same class as the old one. It feels great, it responsive, and is large enough to use comfortably and without moving my hands from the keyboard. I don't see much need to upgrade from the Surface Pro 3 to the 4, but I definitely recommend upgrading the keyboard and pen! The fingerprint scanner is a nice touch and it works great. I've never had to rescan my finger to log in (coming from someone who cannot get phone fingerprint scanners to work ever). However, it's not really necessary. I was hoping that I could use it with a password manager so I could log in to websites with a fingerprint, but I haven't been able to figure that out yet. Whether to get the cover with the scanner or not is a personal choice. Regardless, I recommend either of the updated type covers! Stops working after eight months It stops working completely after eight months. When attached to the SP4, it's as if it is not connected: there is no back light, key presses, the fingerprint reader and the track pad do not have any response. Also tried it on my friend's SP4, it does not work either. While my friend's type cover works on my SP4. My SP4 has the latest update, and I also tried two-button shutdown and reinstalling the driver . Wow, Can It Get Any Better Than This This is the best Surface keyboard yet! Even better than any other tablet or 2-In-1 keyboard I've seen or tried. The keys feel great! You don't even realize it's a detachable system it's so natural feeling. Everything feels just right! Smooth track pad with a nice touch. It's just great! Nice color too. Huge improvement! My old type cover (for Surface Pro 3) finally gave out after I'd pounded away on it for a few years (might have been the dog fur that got inside!) and I had to replace it. I bought the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with fingerprint technology and it works GREAT with my Surface Pro 3. HIGHLY recommend it. The feel and sound of the keys is much more like a regular keyboard, and I love the fingerprint for signing in, etc. Feels great The keyboard has a great feel with it's elevated keys. The only drawback so far is that the fingerprint reader tends not to work whenever I wake the computer from sleep or standby. Worthy Upgrade for the SP3 Using this with an SP3.Fits like a charm (identical dimensions as the previous cover)Slightly better keyboard than the SP3 Type Cover (I liked the SP3 keyboard) - BUT - the track pass is an order of magnitude better.Finger print reader works well.If you have an SP3, this is a great upgrade for the original type cover.

2," Great sound system The home theater system is sound great and also is easy to connect. You can connect it with your cell phone bluetooth and play your music from it. I recommend the home theater system to you. Almost perfect The only issue, is that it comes without a real user manual, or cable to connect to a 3.5mm headphone jack which is common on many phones and almost all computers. The directions are nonexistent, tech support was clueless, I figured it out, but a frustrating experience. The upside is that it has a really nice rich sound, and a built-in digital radio tuner, sd card slot, USB port, and a remotecontrol. Well worth the setup effort, it also looks great. great laptop for collages I really like this store they have amazing products. Wonderful sound Excellent sound more then my expectations it’s really great small price big sound Good product. Very good product, great sound, very easy to setup. It is a really nice system, but there is an issue. First of all, great system overall, nice clear highs, super low hits from sub, but I do have one issue and I don't know if this is supposed to happen or if I have a defective one, but every time there is a lot of bass in a song the air that the sub pushes out is delayed and it rattles to the point where it is very noticeable, so it kind of ruins the sound. Other than that, everything works perfect. If I could have someone tell me if that's meant to happen I would be happy though. Thank You! Great value for money A very good purchase. The sound is just excellent.My housemates can't get enough of it! Excellent For The Price! Just Opened My System Very Satisfied With it,Small And Very Powerful! Simple Hook Up,Clear Crispy Sound And The Sub Is So Powerful With That Ground Shaking Bass! I'm Very Impressed,Seriouly! I Recommend My Brother,He's Ordering 1 Tomorrow! BETTER INSTRUCTION MANUAL I REALLY LIKE THE PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE BUT AS I READ IN OTHER REVIEWS THIS ITEM DO NEED A BETTER INSTRUCTION MANUAL!!!! Loud! For such a small system,this thing packs a nice punch. Nice design,I'm happy overall. Cons- speaker wires in box interfere with bass so it's not as clean as it could be when cranked.Power cord is short.Stick her anywhere and feel the bass!,preferably a corner......Highly recommend. Boy Oh Boytone 36 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No There aren't many computer speaker systems on the market, as far as I know, where blue tooth technology, an FM radio, USB/Micro SD slots and RCA audio input jacks are incorporated right into the sub-woofer allowing you to play music almost anywhere without any other additional equipment or necessary hook ups. With this being said, these were features that attracted me to purchase the BT-210F model.I have never heard of Boytone before. It seems like a relatively new brand and there are not many reviews out there regarding the products that they are currently selling. My purchase was made with some trepidation.Overall, the unit is really nice looking. The pictures shown for the product give the impression that this set up is much bigger than it really is. The only thing that is big would be the sound. This unit can get pretty loud, especially with the sub-woofer.I would have given this review five stars if not, for what some people will find, quite annoying. Surprisingly, no one else who has already purchased this model has even mentioned what I am about to describe.......Each SOURCE volume for AUX, DVD, USB/SD, FM, BL (Bluetooth) has a preset volume. When you first turn the unit on and scroll to AUX, the volume is preset at AU18. When you scroll to DVD, the preset volume is DU18 and so on.Now I am not sure why Boytone decided to design the unit to perform like this but it is somewhat of an inconvenience.Example scenario. If you are on AUX first, the master volume defaults at AU18. That is a pretty high setting for starts, especially if you do not first adjust the volume of the computer or other device you are using the speakers for prior to powering up the sub-woofer.Read more Great speaker even better color and design. 44 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No I got this speaker as a gift and at first I wasn't sure if I would have much use for a speaker/stereo. But I am in love with this speaker. As soon as I opened it, I love the black/checkered color it has all over. It's very convenient for me because it is always connected to my phone via bluetooth, and whenever my friends come over and they want to connect their music, they can just connect their USB drive into the speaker and I never have to disconnect my phone. Great quality sound, and it works great for when I have BBQ's going on in my backyard. Great sound system The home theater system is sound great and also is easy to connect. You can connect it with your cell phone bluetooth and play your music from it. I recommend the home theater system to you. Almost perfect The only issue, is that it comes without a real user manual, or cable to connect to a 3.5mm headphone jack which is common on many phones and almost all computers. The directions are nonexistent, tech support was clueless, I figured it out, but a frustrating experience. The upside is that it has a really nice rich sound, and a built-in digital radio tuner, sd card slot, USB port, and a remotecontrol. Well worth the setup effort, it also looks great. great laptop for collages I really like this store they have amazing products. Wonderful sound Excellent sound more then my expectations it’s really great small price big sound Good product. Very good product, great sound, very easy to setup. It is a really nice system, but there is an issue. First of all, great system overall, nice clear highs, super low hits from sub, but I do have one issue and I don't know if this is supposed to happen or if I have a defective one, but every time there is a lot of bass in a song the air that the sub pushes out is delayed and it rattles to the point where it is very noticeable, so it kind of ruins the sound. Other than that, everything works perfect. If I could have someone tell me if that's meant to happen I would be happy though. Thank You! Great value for money A very good purchase. The sound is just excellent.My housemates can't get enough of it! Excellent For The Price! Just Opened My System Very Satisfied With it,Small And Very Powerful! Simple Hook Up,Clear Crispy Sound And The Sub Is So Powerful With That Ground Shaking Bass! I'm Very Impressed,Seriouly! I Recommend My Brother,He's Ordering 1 Tomorrow! BETTER INSTRUCTION MANUAL I REALLY LIKE THE PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE BUT AS I READ IN OTHER REVIEWS THIS ITEM DO NEED A BETTER INSTRUCTION MANUAL!!!! Loud! For such a small system,this thing packs a nice punch. Nice design,I'm happy overall. Cons- speaker wires in box interfere with bass so it's not as clean as it could be when cranked.Power cord is short.Stick her anywhere and feel the bass!,preferably a corner......Highly recommend. Boy Oh Boytone 36 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No There aren't many computer speaker systems on the market, as far as I know, where blue tooth technology, an FM radio, USB/Micro SD slots and RCA audio input jacks are incorporated right into the sub-woofer allowing you to play music almost anywhere without any other additional equipment or necessary hook ups. With this being said, these were features that attracted me to purchase the BT-210F model.I have never heard of Boytone before. It seems like a relatively new brand and there are not many reviews out there regarding the products that they are currently selling. My purchase was made with some trepidation.Overall, the unit is really nice looking. The pictures shown for the product give the impression that this set up is much bigger than it really is. The only thing that is big would be the sound. This unit can get pretty loud, especially with the sub-woofer.I would have given this review five stars if not, for what some people will find, quite annoying. Surprisingly, no one else who has already purchased this model has even mentioned what I am about to describe.......Each SOURCE volume for AUX, DVD, USB/SD, FM, BL (Bluetooth) has a preset volume. When you first turn the unit on and scroll to AUX, the volume is preset at AU18. When you scroll to DVD, the preset volume is DU18 and so on.Now I am not sure why Boytone decided to design the unit to perform like this but it is somewhat of an inconvenience.Example scenario. If you are on AUX first, the master volume defaults at AU18.

3," Good Bracket Bought this to wall mount a 55 inch flat screen television.Did the job. Easy to mount.Felt secure.Haven't experienced any issues. Sanus VLF410B1 Went up easy, works great Good mount with average ability for install. A good overall TV mount for large screen TV's with average expertise/handyman skills. simply the best no wonder why it's so expensive now. I bought it from JR Music and Computer World (via Amazon) a month ago for less then 150 including shipping. i made a huge research before i bought it. this mount is the best. it has a low profile and yet could be pulled out so you have access to the back of your TV. Makes your TV look awesome on the Wall I love this mount. Very sturdy using quality materials. It does exactly what it says it will do. I am using it with a 55 LG and it looks and works amazing. EASY SET UP Easy to set up!Easy to handle!The slim design almost makes my T.V. Look like its part off the wall,. Five Stars WORKS AS ADVERTISED As advertised Works very well with my 42"" Samsung. I plan on purchasing for my 60"" in the living room as well. Good but be realistic with your TV location and weight. Got a 65 on it. Installation was a breeze. Only complaint is the TV of this size means your studs better be situated so the TV is centered on the mount. There's not enough strength in the bars to allow you to move it right or left without the TV getting off center as it tilts right or left. I was able to make mine work but will be upgrading to a heavier and more expensive version for my den. In hindsight, I should have paid a little more for a heavier duty version. Not a product issue, but me trying to shave a few bucks. I had a better one in other room same brand better build double ... I had a better one in other room same brand better build double the price. if you don't move it a often, I guess it good. but if you want to pull out everytime, I would not buy this one. So far, an excellent mount that behaves as advertised. I've wall-mounted this to an interior bedroom wall with regular 2x4/drywall construction. While somewhat bulky for one person, I managed to install it by myself. It functions as advertised, and everything seems to be working quite well. Articulation is smooth, and post-mount corrections of the tv alignment were trivial. The television is a 50 Samsung LED Smart TV. I recommend this mount (while I actually purchased it from Best Buy). Be sure to mount as directed on studs. A helpful full size template was provided for installation planning. Almost perfect, but watch the specs I installed this for use with a Sony KDL40HX800, a model about 3 years old and weighing less than 40 pounds. This mount is what is found when using the Sanus website Mountfinder for this model. Most of the one star detraction is my fault, but I'll let Sanus share the star because this mount doesn't really have the rotation that I needed. I didn't specifically look at the rotation spec, my fault, but it's only 30 degrees. Even using a TV that's at the very low end of the size spec, this is a pretty low value, and it would be nice to find different models of mounts that feature different specs for different needs. This one is touted to be super slim, and indeed it is, which I needed due to placement in a walkway to a door. Going for this feature sacrificed rotation evidently. The feature of moving laterally is nice, but of dubious value except in very specific circumstances.The other specs of 10 degree tilt, seems to be about actual performance, but the extension from wall value is spec'ed at 10, but was actually 14. The tilt mechanism was the only poor performer. Even with the tension completely released, the sider binds at about 75 tilt. Adding a light coat of lithium grease didn't help. It will achieve full tilt with a firmer jiggle, but it really should be smooth as silk.One outstanding feature is a heavy paper (vinyl coated) template for marking the wall. Many time companies provide newspaper weight templates, which are not stiff enough to get a reliable mark. This template is also dead on for hole location.All the other aspects of the mount are excellent. I have no doubt it would hold full value of weight specified, and is constructed with no corners cut on quality. The instructions are good, and the installation process is well documented with illustrations and correct. The only thing that could be better for installation is the screw selection provided. Two different lengths of M4, M6 and M8 screws are provided for attaching the rails to the TV, depending on how the back of your TV is constructed. For my TV, the M6 14mm was way to short with a short spacer, and not quite long enough with the 40mm and a long spacer. For my TV, something in between 14 and 40 would allow more threads engaged in the TV.So bottom line is that it's almost perfect for what the specs are, but it would be nice if Sanus would provide all mounts that would fit rather than just one.Kudos to Amazon as well. The price dropped from 249 to 199 two days after my order. One call of 2 minutes resulted in the credit of 50. Great TV Mount Lots of nice feature, recommend using their online tool for awesome placement on wall Awesome wall bracket! Easy to install. I purchased this wall mount this weekend and got a really great deal on it! It took about an 1-hour to install and comes with easy directions to mount..Taking measurements probably takes the longest..full tilt and extention of tv ..perfect for different angle's in the home..love my new 70-inch! Worked as advertised! Worked as advertised! Mounted a 55 Vizio, and it works great! I can swivel in either direction and its feels solid. Great Product! Ordered this wall mount unit online. Arrived a few days later. My electricians, who were wiring my room, installed the unit with ease, looks great, works great. The TV is secure and I can swivel the unit to make watching easier from very angle. It seemed sturdy, but I didn't even try to put it ... Just a heads up, this mount won't go 90 degrees out from the wall with a 65 TV. It seemed sturdy, but I didn't even try to put it together after I realized I had ordered the wrong mount I got a prompt refund from amazon. I mean that same day. Anyways, if you want to go 90 or even further (if you mount it on a corner like I did) you'll want the sanus Full motion + version. Yes, the plus is important! Solid quality. Not the easiest to extend Well built, and solid on the wall. Doesn't always slide easily to extend from the wall to turn, but weight of 65"" TV is a factor. Overall very good product. TV (height) is not centered on the wall Mounted this unit on the wall, then realized that the height of the TV is not centered on the mount, it's about 6 lower on the mount that I expected. As a result, I have an exposed outlet on the wall (above the mount) that I thought would be hidden had the tv's height been centered based on the holes I drilled in the wall to mount the Sanus unit. Very strong and sturdy Easy to follow instructions, very sturdy, not a huge turning range but enough for a big TV. We a pleased with the product. Great solid product Installation:Easy--I was able to do this myself without help--just need a stud finder and basic toolsAppearance:Professional look--the cable guides work well.Good Buy Sturdy & easy wall mount I bought this wall mount for my 64"" Samsung, having never hung a tv before. I wanted a full-motion wall mount, which is what this says it is, however it doesn't move/tilt as much as the full-motion mount displayed in the store. Overall though, I'm very happy with my purchase. perfect buy it from amazon its cheaper perfect buy it from amazon its cheaper.... I have an 80 Vizio and its holding it perfect and very flexible to plug more inputs at the back with the swivel feature....

4," Nice clear vocals Great speaker if you want the best vocals in music lacks a little bit of bass but it all depends on preference Great large bluetooth speaker I have the first Boom and enjoyed the operation and sound of that speaker but wished it had more sound. When the Megablast was released I decided to get it. I am glad I did as this speaker is a large upgrade from the boom even though the boom was great. The setup is easy and the huge plus is it has Alexa. If you are looking for a bluetooth speaker, portable, long battery life and Alexa this is the speaker to get. One of the better speakers out there AND Alexa! I will start by saying we love our Echo and Alexa, and now that we have the opportunity to take her mobile we love it!Performance wise, this is a pretty good speaker as far as bluetooth speakers go. It is one of the loudest ones I have. I wish it would pair with other speakers for stereo sound, but it isn't a deal breaker. It is easy to connect to and having Alexa on the go is pretty cool. If you are looking for a waterproof speaker, you can't go wrong. Not ready for primetime I was really excited about this speaker, but unfortunately this is the worst bluetooth speaker I've ever used. The sound quality is clean and crisp. Has some bass, but not a lot. The issue seems to be it's ability to keep a connection, and the Alexa support. It's very buggy and needs work. Whenever I have my phone paired to the speaker via Bluetooth, then ask the speaker a question using it's builtin Alexa feature, I hear nothing but hiss and static. When I go back to playing music, the sound will be from my phone only. I have to repair the Bluetooth connection. I have to do this every time I attempt to ask the speaker a question. The Alexa feature doesn't seem to work at all. If I ask it a question, I get 10 seconds of hissing noise. They have an Android app. It appears many people are having issues with their app. The rating for their app is quite low, with numerous complaints. I can't recommend this speaker at the moment. Perhaps an update will address these issues. Wow! I have had several different bluetooth speakers over the years including Anker and Lifepoof. This is my first Ultimate Ears speaker and all I can say is 'Wow!'. Seriously, this speaker is impressive. It is waterproof and drop proof from around 1 meter up. It is solid, fairly heavy, and feels very premium. It has 16 hours of battery life at mid volume and built-in wi-fi for Alexa use. Let's start with audio quality since that is why you buy a bluetooth speaker. It is nothing short of marvelous in that department. Easily the best sounding bluetooth speaker I have ever heard. Great highs, mids, and very acceptable lows. The two 55mm drivers coupled with the two tweeters do a remarkable job filling a room with clear, musical sound. Plus, this thing gets VERY loud. It easily fills my first floor with sound. Even at max volume there is minimal distortion with bass heavy music which is a real plus. Once you install the app on your mobile device you can get Alexa up and running in no time. I have several Alexa enabled devices in my home ranging from Hue lights and Harmony remote controls to vacuums and sprinkler system. It works them all just like an Echo and the mic easily picks me up from the other side of my house even (albeit at a raised voice). I also have the charging base which is a must in my opinion if you plan to use the Alexa controls as well as keep it portable too. It's a shame the base doesn't come with it for the price.Overall, I can't recommend this speaker enough. Yes, it is pricey, but you get what you pay for in this case. Outside of a Sonos speaker (which isn't truly portable) I haven't heard a better battery powered Alexa enabled speaker (bluetooth or not). It really is fantastic. Perfect for a kickback or small party! This speaker blew me away as soon as I paired it with my iPhone. The music sounds so good and crisp and the base on this Speaker is amazing for its size. The app was easy to use and pairing was easy as well. The sound quality is what really blew me away because I did not expect it to sound so good!! The speaker it self comes in a nice looking box and was well packaged. The fact that it has built in Amazon Alexa is just an added bonus because I would pay the asking price without it. I also got the base for the speaker that you just dock it and it starts charging which is a very useful feature. Easily fills the room with amazing sound quality!Pros:LoudBaseSound qualityLong battery lifeAmazon AlexaEasy to charge with the base (not included with speaker) Cons:... can’t think of any! Maybe just the price? Great speaker Alexa work really goodTremendous soundIncredible baseReally good The Best of Both Worlds What do you get when you combine the best Bluetooth speaker with Amazon's Echo technology? The UE Megablast.Logitech has been putting out great sounding speakers for years with the Ultimate Ears series. And now they have added Amazon's interactive technology to make their speakers that much better. Want to listen to your favorite playlist with a simple voice command? Done. Interested in hearing the day's weather report? You got it. Want to connect to your smart thermostat to adjust your home's temperature? Yes, it can do that too.Simply, this speaker eliminates the need for two separate devices in your home. The optional charging dock comes in handy to keep it charged if you plan on moving it often. I keep it docked at all times unless I am taking it outside to do yardwork. The volume is the loudest I have found in a Bluetooth speaker and music does not get distorted even at high levels. Despite combining the capabilities of Alexa and an amazing sounding speaker, the price is still reasonable. I highly recommend this device for anyone that is looking for the highest quality audio mixed with a smart home experience. Awesome Sound, perfect for the outdoors with Alexa This speaker is loud. From the tech specs, the speaker has a max output of 93 decibels, which is a 40% increase, can I tell if it is 40% louder, not sure but I can be a good 30-50 feet and have no problems hearing the speaker when I compared it to other Bluetooth speakers that I had. For me the sound reaches everywhere in my back yard and my back yard is about a half acre. It has 360 coverage and it really didn't matter where I was in my back yard, the music sounded great from all angles. It sounds very clear and doesn't have that muddy sound you hear on other speakers when you turn up the volume all of the way. Wifi is rated at 330 feet for wifi and 150 for Bluetooth. I could reach a signal anywhere in my yard and I had a solid Bluetooth connection from 35 feet or so. No drop outs and the sound was great. Battery life is good. One thing I like is that the charger is wireless charging dock so I could really charge the speaker anywhere I went and it gave it a nice base to keep off the table. The battery is rated for 16 hours and I got close to that, but I was near a strong wifi signal and I kept the volume level at about half. I am not sure what happens to the battery life if it is not near a strong wifi signal, but battery life does take a hit if you play at max levels. Alexa is built in so you get hands free access to music services such as Amazon music, iHeartRadio and TuneIn. It looks like Pandora and Deezer will work in the near future. You get access to other Alexa services such as news, weather, auidiobooks, voice control for IoT devices, general questions and 25,000 Alexa commands. Set up is through a new UE app which connects your wifi network and links you Amazon account for the Alexa functions. Since the speaker is WiFi capable, the speaker will get updates quickly for Alexa functions. One of the benefits about being connected to wifi is now your music won't stop when someone is calling you. The Pros:More durable and portable version of the EchoMuch louder and clearer than an EchoSounds much clearer at loud levels, doesn't sound muddyIP67 water resistant. Alexa is always listening no more having to press a button Some Cons:There is no head phone jack, I know not everyone uses one and a speaker is typically so everyone can hear it, but some people will want the earphone access. Can't link older UE speakers and for now you can only play music through one Megablast at a time. Right now only Amazon Music, iHeartRadios and TuneIn are available for streaming music directly. Pandora and Deezer are set to be in the future. So if you use Apple music or Spotify you are out of luck. Can't make Alexa phone calls. I really like this speaker, one of the better sounding ones at full volume. If you need a loud, great sounding portable speaker that has Alexa functions built in so you can be hands free and is water resistant, this is the speaker for you. This thing ROCKS! Easy pairing with my phone. Great sound and clarity! Great Speaker This is the best Bluetooth speaker I ever heard. Thanks Best speaker for everyone Easy Bluetooth connection, remember last device it was hooked up to if your like myself and have multiple Bluetooth devices. I've noticed my other devices tend to prioritize iOS over Android but this doesn't do that. Amazon Alexa is heavily integrated with the UE MegaBlast. If your a heavy user of Amazon services and product this is for you. If not as a Bluetooth speaker there's other options at this price point that will give you better physical controls, unless you prefer voice control for things like skip, previous track, volume. If you have smart home devices connected to Alexa you'll be able to control them thought this speaker. The only draw back I can find with this was the missing controls like the UE Mega Boom speaker. Touch controls are missing like placing your hand over the top to mute a song, tapping to skip a song. These sound allot better than the boom since this unit has bigger speakers than the other units. Water and dust proofing on all UE products are great, taken to parks, beaches, tailgating, pool parties I can say these speaker are 2 year old proof as well. Thrown in pools, buried under sand castle, tossed from slowly moving truck bed. While still looking new since the fabric used hasn't shown any wear or tear. Software is upgradeable, I foresee a long life with this speaker. Which brings me to battery life, 16 hours at mid level volume which is okay for this type of speaker. Overall I enjoy this speaker, being a heavily user of all things Amazon this is an easy integration of my Amazon ecosystem. Since voice control is getting better I prefer voice over tactile controls. The protections you get are better than most Bluetooth speaker on the market. Speaker plays so loud it's too loud! Speaker is fantastic! Bigger than the Megaboom and louder than imagined! Pretty good This is a pretty good speaker but doesn’t have all the functionality that the Megaboom had. For example, ability to pair up other UE speakers, control volume from the app, etc. I’m sure all those features plus much more will be avaialable with coming updates.

Whenever I have my phone paired to the speaker via Bluetooth, then ask the speaker a question using it's builtin Alexa feature, I hear nothing but hiss and static. When I go back to playing music, the sound will be from my phone only. I have to repair the Bluetooth connection. I have to do this every time I attempt to ask the speaker a question. The Alexa feature doesn't seem to work at all. If I ask it a question, I get 10 seconds of hissing noise. They have an Android app. It appears many people are having issues with their app. The rating for their app is quite low, with numerous complaints. I can't recommend this speaker at the moment. Perhaps an update will address these issues. Wow! I have had several different bluetooth speakers over the years including Anker and Lifepoof. This is my first Ultimate Ears speaker and all I can say is 'Wow!'. Seriously, this speaker is impressive. It is waterproof and drop proof from around 1 meter up. It is solid, fairly heavy, and feels very premium. It has 16 hours of battery life at mid volume and built-in wi-fi for Alexa use. Let's start with audio quality since that is why you buy a bluetooth speaker. It is nothing short of marvelous in that department. Easily the best sounding bluetooth speaker I have ever heard. Great highs, mids, and very acceptable lows. The two 55mm drivers coupled with the two tweeters do a remarkable job filling a room with clear, musical sound. Plus, this thing gets VERY loud. It easily fills my first floor with sound. Even at max volume there is minimal distortion with bass heavy music which is a real plus. Once you install the app on your mobile device you can get Alexa up and running in no time. I have several Alexa enabled devices in my home ranging from Hue lights and Harmony remote controls to vacuums and sprinkler system. It works them all just like an Echo and the mic easily picks me up from the other side of my house even (albeit at a raised voice). I also have the charging base which is a must in my opinion if you plan to use the Alexa controls as well as keep it portable too. It's a shame the base doesn't come with it for the price.Overall, I can't recommend this speaker enough. Yes, it is pricey, but you get what you pay for in this case. Outside of a Sonos speaker (which isn't truly portable) I haven't heard a better battery powered Alexa enabled speaker (bluetooth or not). It really is fantastic. Perfect for a kickback or small party! This speaker blew me away as soon as I paired it with my iPhone. The music sounds so good and crisp and the base on this Speaker is amazing for its size. The app was easy to use and pairing was easy as well. The sound quality is what really blew me away because I did not expect it to sound so good!! The speaker it self comes in a nice looking box and was well packaged. The fact that it has built in Amazon Alexa is just an added bonus because I would pay the asking price without it. I also got the base for the speaker that you just dock it and it starts charging which is a very useful feature. Easily fills the room with amazing sound quality!Pros:LoudBaseSound qualityLong battery lifeAmazon AlexaEasy to charge with the base (not included with speaker) Cons:... can’t think of any! Maybe just the price? Great speaker Alexa work really goodTremendous soundIncredible baseReally good The Best of Both Worlds What do you get when you combine the best Bluetooth speaker with Amazon's Echo technology? The UE Megablast.Logitech has been putting out great sounding speakers for years with the Ultimate Ears series. And now they have added Amazon's interactive technology to make their speakers that much better. Want to listen to your favorite playlist with a simple voice command? Done. Interested in hearing the day's weather report? You got it. Want to connect to your smart thermostat to adjust your home's temperature? Yes, it can do that too.Simply, this speaker eliminates the need for two separate devices in your home. The optional charging dock comes in handy to keep it charged if you plan on moving it often. I keep it docked at all times unless I am taking it outside to do yardwork. The volume is the loudest I have found in a Bluetooth speaker and music does not get distorted even at high levels. Despite combining the capabilities of Alexa and an amazing sounding speaker, the price is still reasonable. I highly recommend this device for anyone that is looking for the highest quality audio mixed with a smart home experience. Awesome Sound, perfect for the outdoors with Alexa This speaker is loud. From the tech specs, the speaker has a max output of 93 decibels, which is a 40% increase, can I tell if it is 40% louder, not sure but I can be a good 30-50 feet and have no problems hearing the speaker when I compared it to other Bluetooth speakers that I had. For me the sound reaches everywhere in my back yard and my back yard is about a half acre. It has 360 coverage and it really didn't matter where I was in my back yard, the music sounded great from all angles. It sounds very clear and doesn't have that muddy sound you hear on other speakers when you turn up the volume all of the way. Wifi is rated at 330 feet for wifi and 150 for Bluetooth. I could reach a signal anywhere in my yard and I had a solid Bluetooth connection from 35 feet or so. No drop outs and the sound was great. Battery life is good. One thing I like is that the charger is wireless charging dock so I could really charge the speaker anywhere I went and it gave it a nice base to keep off the table. The battery is rated for 16 hours and I got close to that, but I was near a strong wifi signal and I kept the volume level at about half. I am not sure what happens to the battery life if it is not near a strong wifi signal, but battery life does take a hit if you play at max levels. Alexa is built in so you get hands free access to music services such as Amazon music, iHeartRadio and TuneIn. It looks like Pandora and Deezer will work in the near future. You get access to other Alexa services such as news, weather, auidiobooks, voice control for IoT devices, general questions and 25,000 Alexa commands. Set up is through a new UE app which connects your wifi network and links you Amazon account for the Alexa functions. Since the speaker is WiFi capable, the speaker will get updates quickly for Alexa functions. One of the benefits about being connected to wifi is now your music won't stop when someone is calling you. The Pros:More durable and portable version of the EchoMuch louder and clearer than an EchoSounds much clearer at loud levels, doesn't sound muddyIP67 water resistant. Alexa is always listening no more having to press a button Some Cons:There is no head phone jack, I know not everyone uses one and a speaker is typically so everyone can hear it, but some people will want the earphone access. Can't link older UE speakers and for now you can only play music through one Megablast at a time. Right now only Amazon Music, iHeartRadios and TuneIn are available for streaming music directly. Pandora and Deezer are set to be in the future.

11," Lasted 9 Months My problem was that the laptop was no longer charging. Purchased this Lenovo adapter and it worked at first. Now, nine months later, it is doing the same thing it did before. Works fine with Thinkpad X1 Carbon Touch I bought this to use as a travel adapter for my Thinkpad X1 Carbon Touch, and it works fine in that regard.I did, however, get caught off guard because this adapter uses a triple-pronged plug, not the two-prong that Thinkpad chargers generally come with. This makes the cord that comes with it a little bulkier than I expected and I wasn't able to use my extra-long two-prong cord. I didn't see this called out in the product description, so if you are often in a situation where you're dealing with ungrounded outlets, be aware. What I needed! This cable was the exact same one I needed for my Lenovo flex 15! Works fine with my Lenovo laptop X240 I have had problems with some adapters working with some of my previous laptops. This one works great with my Lenovo laptop X240. Warning! NOT Genuine! Crappy QC! I was in a rather desperate spot when my original laptop charger up and quit. Nabbed this one, and it seemed to work ok. After only a week or so, I now have the problem where it repeatedly stops and starts charging every few seconds when plugged in. Basically, the charger is useless to me.You may notice that this one costs 20 whereas the same thing from Lenovo, Best Buy etc. is in the 40+ range. There's a reason - this is a knockoff, despite the Lenovo labeling all over it. The biggest giveaway is that this one lacks a barcode - all Lenovo chargers should have a barcode which contains model number, serial number etc. but this one does not. There are probably other ways to tell this one is fake, but that was the most obvious.Perhaps these may work for some people. But if your laptop is essential for your life in general (as it is for me), then spend the extra and buy genuine. It's worth it. Genuine adapter/slim tip but not slim travel adapter The adapter I got works and appears to be a genuine Lenovo. It's 3-prong, but it's in the Lenovo FRU list for my machine (t440s). It's worth noting however that while the adapter I got has the new slim-tip connector, it is not a slim adapter - just a typical brick. The listing isn't exactly clear on this. Also worth noting that I ordered from Notebook Parts Outlet and received a 65W adapter due to stock issues with the 45W - not exactly what I was looking for due to weight reasons, but it works as well (and they refunded my shipping charges when questioned about this).

13," Memory Works as memory should and it worked with my Rizen processor. Great for building a gaming computer Just what was needed and works great for the new computer Good value Used 1 stick in each of my mining rigs. Decent price and could use 1 stick in each rig. Great! Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good, but first one hardware fault Theyre good, fast and doing exactly like they should. The first one had a hardware fault at about 17-20 days. I have 4 sticks all working well. Great memory My computer wasn't turning on. I got this RAM and it fired right up. Good DDR4 memory. exactly what I needed Perfect, Great Price, Exactly as advertised. !!!!! Made older computer so much better I'd been debating whether or not to upgrade our older (well, four years old) computer that is mainly used for gaming. It's been having problems with overclocking games especially when the graphics get very animated. In the middle of a big battle, having the screen freeze or pixilate makes a person want to chuck the keyboard across the room. After looking into the cost of upgrading the memory, video card, and processor versus the cost of a new tower, it was s bit of a toss up. When this DD4 memory became available, it was enough to sway my choice and I'm very glad I did. I though with a new video card and upgraded AMD processor games played much better, but with this new memory upgrade on board, WOW.These sticks are very easy to install, and I like that their open design helps to dissipate heat. They took just a few minutes to physically install and then a few more while the computer recognized and adapted to the upgrade. There are zero problems now with overclocking. Everything runs beautifully and smoothly, from Fallout 4 to crazy cat videos on the interwebs. I do wish that these sticks were 2x8GB so I could do four of those for 32GB, but I really can't complain as the computer works so much better now. Great Gamer Memory Good quality and functions well. Easy to install and sped up my PC. No Complaints Easy to install. Does what its supposed to do. Good price. No complaints. Great Great RAM for the price as usual it was easy to install. Great for more space I needed more speed and space for gaming and this was a great add. Great memory for the price Bought 2 of these while on sale. Great value for the money. Wrong they gave me the wrong ram and thank goodness i didnt break my computer. Fast RAM This is was a upgrade for my HP desktop went from 8 to 16 GIGs of RAM, supper fast response and has been a great help to online gaming. No issues installing and is straight plug and play. Fast Great ram. Very fast. Expensive but worth it if you need a quick upgrade Great RAM! Good performing RAM for the price. Easy to install. Make sure to set bios to work with the new speeds. Perfect I purchased this as extra memory for my Alienware PC. Easy to install, speed is spot on and these have good heatsinks!Would definitely buy again. Great RAM which can be found much cheaper in store I ran this RAM at 2133 MHz because at the time I had a 6th gen Intel processor. I really did not have any issues with the product except for the fact that on several non Z series mobos (MSI, Gygabyte) it would only run in single channel mode and unfortunately did not have a Intel XMP profile (really not a big deal if you research stable OC voltages and don't get hung up on stuff you don't need). But none the less I was able to play any game I wanted with ease. 16 GB at 2133 really is more than most people need and chances are if you are just beginning to build your own PC this will be an extremely good upgrade. It runs very fast, stable and most of all cool. I am posting some pics below and this setup has never ran past 28 degrees even when I have increased voltages. A good tip for any new builder is to just spend the extra cash on a Z series mobo so you can really play with and learn what your RAM and CPU can do. PNY has also honored their lifetime warranty for me with two other products with little hassle so I can't complain. Do some digging around and you will find this is a great $90-110 upgrade. PNY is great via email but not so much by phone btw. Purchase for my son It had a good price for my son that's fixing his computer Easy to install Easy to install. Met needs. Highly recommend this to all Works well and was local I needed some working ram in a hurry and they had it in my local store. Works well and looks good. Works Great! Bought this for my teenage son for his new computer. Works great! Great for the ASUS I7 I got at Best Buy Bought the Asus M32 Series PC at Best Buy, 3 months later the ram fried somehow, So went back to Best Buy and bought these ram chips, brought them home installed them and PC fired right back up again. Didn't want to bother with warranty and 12Gigs of ram, when I could just put 16Gigs in and be done with it. RAM POWER This RAM great improved the performance of my desktop computer.

14," JUST WHAT THE DR ORDERED A friend told me about this little device for watching YV while away from my house. I had heard of it but really didn't know what it was. Well, I wish he had told me about it earlier! It does everything as advertised and is a breeze to set up and use. In reading some of the reviews, prior to purchase, it wasn't clear to me if the Slingbox would connect wirelessly to my home network or if I had to hardwire it to my router. Some claimed yes, some said it wasn't. Well, I'm here to say it is wireless. Connected to my home network in no time. Just follow the instructions that come with it and you will have no trouble. ""IT WORKS"" Does it all, can watch any home TV program remotely Worth the investment of you travel. i live away from sports teams I follow. I put the sling box on a spare TV in a family members house so I can keep up with sports teams. The new model allows me to broadcast to my roku from my phone. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that it techs a minimal amount of tech savvy to set up Needed an update. Needed to update my slingbox solo to work with Amazon Fire TV Stick, works great and easy to setup! Great product Works great for watching Football when you are away from home. did want was expected great on computer and ipad. on iphone remote a little difficult but it worked well Works well, but no surround sound when streaming. So far I've been pretty happy with the purchase, but found out after purchasing it, it does not have the capability to output 5.1 sound when streaming. I also had some issues when using Ethernet instead of wifi. Usually Ethernet is more reliable and faster, but that is not the case with my slingbox. I'm not sure if it is hardware or software, but I dropped connection all the time when using Ethernet, so I went back to using wifi and it works fine again. Does the job I had to upgrade my slingbox from the classic due to my directv box upgrade. It does the job well. There are some streaming hiccups here and there but I think it may be my network. The Mac app doesn't work with this slingbox but the web browser does work. The iOS apps still work fine with this one. Works great I use this on multiple devices works great. Would recommend it. Great discovery for travelers As a frequent traveler outside the US, I was constantly frustrated at not being able to watch the TV shows that I love. After hearing about Slingbox I researched it as a viable connection of my TV service to a personal up streaming service that I could watch anytime, anywhere. I discussed my needs with the Best Buy staff and finally selected this model. As I write this I am in a weeks-long trip in which I have been able to watch TV shows and my own recorded shows directly from my box! One of the best recent technical discoveries in our household. Works well. Purchased this instead of having a cable box in the kitchen. So far it works well, but the are some quirks. It can be a little temperamental the when it comes to setting it up with the Xfinity X1 platform. The guide won't load all the channels and the app itself does need a little work, especially if you buy the app at $15. Great prodcut Great product especially when you're bored. Watching tv anywhere with internet great product for on the go i used it while on a business trip and while at a friends. works great, easy controls.....the only caveat is you need fast internet if not it lags a lot and is very frustrating. Works well Works well with Direct TV. Relatively easy to set up. Great Excellent does everything I want it too. I use it to watch tv anywhere I want Christmas Gift The Sling box is great. It offers the perfect way to enjoy your television from another location. It is a great money saver. Works I bought the first slingbox ever made available and had to replace it. This one did it. I probably use slingbox everyday and this one covers it. Worth the money if you want to take your tv (via internet/smart device)with you wherever there is wifi. Great gadget for TV lovers I bought this Slingbox to use when on vacation although you do need Internet access it works well with my Directv service. I have access on my iPad and iPhone only wish that Apple TV would add Slingbox to their content along with what's already there. Very happy with my purchase. Your TV everywhere I love this product. It virtually let's you watch your paid TV anywhere you want. The only thing I wish it did better is improved response time when trying to navigate your cable box. Great product Serves its purpose well. I enjoy it in my home office so much I've bought one for my niece as a high school graduation gift. I use it with my Roku 3. Excellent I feel the router is very help. After purchasing a rather large house I need to buy a bigger wireless router to reach my basement and bedroom. I did some research before hand and felt this would be my best option. Slingbox M2 I had the previous model (non WIFI) of the Slingbox and the Ethernet port stopped working. The M2 replacement is just awesome. Took me literally 2 minutes to install and it worked right out of the box. Only issue I have is with the Verizon box which does not allow 2 HDMI to connected do had to use component instead. Either way love the new product. Better than older version of slingbox Works relatively well; picture is almost as good as directly viewing cable. Set up somewhat difficult and required two phone calls to tech support Good option for a slingbox Has been working just as well as the more expensive models. Does not use HDMI, but uses component. The WiFi is working perfectly. Mr I love the idea of a sling box, but this is definitely not ready. Constantly buffering and freezes. Then it runs great for about 5-10 minuets, then freezes and buffers again. Very frustrating !!!!. Not worth the hassle. I would NOT recommend this product. Best Buy Best Buy don't stand behind there problems The unit was broke out of my box.17 day's of fooling around with productThey wanted nothing to do with my M2Sling Box also sling box has very tough rules.Buyers be where. get your cable anywhere- I use device for streaming NFL games and other programs that are blacked out from my cable providers mobile/internet platforms. Easy insallation Great product. Offers so many options and insalled in minutes. Love it. Works great for watching home TV while away. Easy to install and operate. Works great with a computer or our mobile devices... Great device for Stream This device is awesome! No annual fee and screen is more clear than I thought.. Everything works just like advertised The only thing missing was the ability to record TV shows. Sling box anywhere Watch TV anywhere, it's the best thing ever. Sling box anywhere and it's awesome. Great product Use with Roku Streaming Stick and SlingPlayer App to watch on TV without having to rent another cable box. Is also great to be able to stream and watch TV on phone or tablet when away from home. Good streaming video quality Good quality with 10 Mbps internet connection speed. Quality is dependent on network speed. Good product for the price Worse than the old Slingboxes I bought this to replace my old 10 year old Slingbox. This product is inferior. When watching via mobile, the signal will give out and go black after several minutes and not come back unless I close and restart the program. When watching at home using a laptop on the same network, the signal won't disappear completely... it will just go to a black screen every several minutes, but then continue streaming after a few seconds. Super annoying and I didn't have any of these issues with the old Slingbox. Plus there are ads on this Slingbox so I have to watch the ads again every time I restart because their signal is so poor. Great product! I can see the tv lineup from back home when I'm away! great product Encourage to purchase this item. I can watch exactly what I want with no troubles at all. Love my Slingbox I've been looking at Slingboxes for years and finally got one. Liked it so much that I bought my Son-in-Law one. I viewed mine when I was in the hospital for a week by hooking a FireStick to the hospital TV. The firestick is the easiest way to control the Slingbox, although the other ways are not hard. I use my Slingbox by means of the Firestick as a second program source for a second tv in my ManCave primarily. SLINGBOX M2 The Slingbox M2 works well but slowly. Switching stations does not always happen from the first input which is frustrating. I chose this one over the HDMI upgraded one because the HDMI coding sometimes restricts transmission of HDMI quality movies and programs. The clarity on the M2 works well with us. Great for watching home tv Easy to installGreat picture and easy to use Minimal time needed Great invention The sling box is awesome and allows you to see your tv from anywhere. Love it and will buy it again Easy setup Now I'm able to keep up with local news and all of my favorite channels while I'm out of town. Why shouldn't I be able to see the cable I pay for on all of my devices without having to pay more to view each one. Especially great if you have a vacation home and don't want to pay for enhanced channels in both places. compact The m2 model is nice and compact to tuck away in our entertainment console Slingbox This product was as ratites does everything you need it to do one thing I do not like is that you have to watch a add everytime you open up the free app for paying a 100 it should be included Sling Media - Slingbox M2 Sling Media - Slingbox M2 allows us to enjoy our favorite shows from home while we are on the road! Does what it is supposed to Streaming requires high speed internet and a strong wifi signal to work properly. Cable anywhere, works great I basically live at my girlfriends house but she doesnt have cable. As a big sports fan, I needed cable for specific channels that arent available through streaming apps such as NBC Sports, Fox Sports Go, or even Sling TV's a la carte packages (although they have lot to offer for monthly subscriptions less than what cable companies charge). I connected the slingbox to an extra cable box at my parents house and ive been able to pick it up through the Fire Stick at my girlfriend's house on the Sling Player app. As long as you have good networking in both locations the stream is pretty darn good. I downloaded the Sling Player app on my phone and I am able to watch TV at work as well. You can bring it anywhere. It is a great solution that has been a game changer. Awrsome If you want to take your tv anywhere this is the product for you. Great casting device For anyone that's had it with annoying buffering from their cable company's TV streaming, get this little box. Initial setup can be a little confusing especially with WI-FI. Just make sure the Slingbox and device you're casting to are on the same network. Also make sure you download the phone, tablet, PC, or Mac specific app for each device. The tablet app for example will not work with your phone. App can be a bit temperamental at times, especially when trying to initially connect. Some of the app's graphic interface is not as intuitive as I would have liked. It takes a little while to learn how to navigate through the options. OK, now the pluses. The picture quality is great. True HD with very little or no buffering. I can even watch DVR recorded shows on my tablet. The coolest feature is the virtual TV remote. Its an on-screen replica of your TV/cable remote. The free app has some startup ads, which are not overly intrusive. In fact, you can skip the commercial after a few seconds. A great little device (much smaller than I thought it would be) that very effectively acts as a second cable box. The somewhat minor caveats expressed above prevent me from giving it a full 5 stars. JUST WHAT THE DR ORDERED A friend told me about this little device for watching YV while away from my house. I had heard of it but really didn't know what it was. Well, I wish he had told me about it earlier! It does everything as advertised and is a breeze to set up and use. In reading some of the reviews, prior to purchase, it wasn't clear to me if the Slingbox would connect wirelessly to my home network or if I had to hardwire it to my router. Some claimed yes, some said it wasn't. Well, I'm here to say it is wireless. Connected to my home network in no time. Just follow the instructions that come with it and you will have no trouble. ""IT WORKS"" Does it all, can watch any home TV program remotely Worth the investment of you travel. i live away from sports teams I follow. I put the sling box on a spare TV in a family members house so I can keep up with sports teams. The new model allows me to broadcast to my roku from my phone. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that it techs a minimal amount of tech savvy to set up Needed an update. Needed to update my slingbox solo to work with Amazon Fire TV Stick, works great and easy to setup! Great product Works great for watching Football when you are away from home. did want was expected great on computer and ipad. on iphone remote a little difficult but it worked well Works well, but no surround sound when streaming. So far I've been pretty happy with the purchase, but found out after purchasing it, it does not have the capability to output 5.1 sound when streaming. I also had some issues when using Ethernet instead of wifi. Usually Ethernet is more reliable and faster, but that is not the case with my slingbox. I'm not sure if it is hardware or software, but I dropped connection all the time when using Ethernet, so I went back to using wifi and it works fine again. Does the job I had to upgrade my slingbox from the classic due to my directv box upgrade. It does the job well. There are some streaming hiccups here and there but I think it may be my network. The Mac app doesn't work with this slingbox but the web browser does work. The iOS apps still work fine with this one. Works great I use this on multiple devices works great. Would recommend it. Great discovery for travelers As a frequent traveler outside the US, I was constantly frustrated at not being able to watch the TV shows that I love. After hearing about Slingbox I researched it as a viable connection of my TV service to a personal up streaming service that I could watch anytime, anywhere. I discussed my needs with the Best Buy staff and finally selected this model. As I write this I am in a weeks-long trip in which I have been able to watch TV shows and my own recorded shows directly from my box! One of the best recent technical discoveries in our household. Works well. Purchased this instead of having a cable box in the kitchen. So far it works well, but the are some quirks. It can be a little temperamental the when it comes to setting it up with the Xfinity X1 platform. The guide won't load all the channels and the app itself does need a little work, especially if you buy the app at $15. Great prodcut Great product especially when you're bored. Watching tv anywhere with internet great product for on the go i used it while on a business trip and while at a friends. works great, easy controls.....the only caveat is you need fast internet if not it lags a lot and is very frustrating. Works well Works well with Direct TV. Relatively easy to set up. Great Excellent does everything I want it too. I use it to watch tv anywhere I want Christmas Gift The Sling box is great. It offers the perfect way to enjoy your television from another location. It is a great money saver. Works I bought the first slingbox ever made available and had to replace it. This one did it. I probably use slingbox everyday and this one covers it. Worth the money if you want to take your tv (via internet/smart device)with you wherever there is wifi. Great gadget for TV lovers I bought this Slingbox to use when on vacation although you do need Internet access it works well with my Directv service. I have access on my iPad and iPhone only wish that Apple TV would add Slingbox to their content along with what's already there. Very happy with my purchase. Your TV everywhere I love this product. It virtually let's you watch your paid TV anywhere you want. The only thing I wish it did better is improved response time when trying to navigate your cable box. Great product Serves its purpose well. I enjoy it in my home office so much I've bought one for my niece as a high school graduation gift. I use it with my Roku 3.

Only shows the artist and not the name of the song. The preset buttons are too small. Great unit for the cost This unit works great and looks great. It provides great features for the cost Excellent stereo. I needed a good stereo without a CD player and this item fit the bill. Easy to use and great sound. Nice car stereo with built-in bluetooth Nice clear stereo but the microphone for use with Bluetooth isn't as clear as we were hoping for when answering calls. Hands free phone The Bluetooth works great and is a must with the new laws about distracted driving. Great car stereo I've had this for over a month and this stereo is great. Easy to install, setup and operate. I have a 32 micro flash card installed in the USB slot and play all my music through there. I have streamed iheart over Bluetooth and it works flawlessly with my iPhone 6. If you need to charge your phone you can do so by plugging in the USB as well. Easy to use this stereo was easy to install andphook up our bluetooth devices. great radio for price This radio is great for the price. Bluetooth feature is a plus! Great head unit I bought this unit for the Bluetooth and the price but was very surprised by the performance pushing a pair of 6 1/2"" and 6*8 kicker speakers. Nice, affordable upgrade from stock radio I purchased and installed this myself in a 2005 Saturn L300 that still had the all original system, which sounded terrible. I thought my speakers needed replaced, too, but after hooking up this new unit, they sound almost 100% better. For the features and sound quality you get with this unit, it is a great deal. I love that I can plug in my iPod classic to the USB, and use the receiver's controls for it. Very handy when driving. I debated whether I wanted a unit with CD player capability, but decided I'd rather pay a little less and do without. I rarely (almost never) use CDs anyway.This unit was quite simple to wire up, using the metra harness and dash kit.Had a little trouble figuring out how to link my android phone with Bluetooth, but realized what step I was missing. Now it works like a charm.Love this media receiver for the price. Great product, great price. Bought this for my husbands car. He loves it. Stock stereo stopped working and now he has bluetooth. Great radio Great radio, especially for someone who hates CDs and uses their phone for music. Simple menu navigation. Overall easy to operate. Nice car receiver Easy install easy to use and operate remote and Bluetooth work excellent. Plan to purchase another unit for another vehicle real soon. Great value! Great Features Great Value Listen - any radio you install on a boat is only good fora year or two, so why pay the big bucks?This unit included AM/FM, Sat, USB, Bluetooth, and Aux.I can play on it from anywhere AND it had a microphoneso If I have my phone playing, and it rings, I can answer itfrom the boat using this radio.GREAT value Great Features! It was what it said it was Works good and I have no complaintsIt was a gift for my grandson- he likes it Terrific value While this is a more expensive alternative to a wired iTrip transmitter, it is not expensive compared to its sister products AND it's a great value for the performance. I use this to Bluetooth my smartphone to play music, talk while driving, or get Pandora. Only four stars, losing one for having to reset the tuner to the smartphone every time I get in the car instead of it remembering. However, it may be because I haven't figured out how to fix the setting yet. I love it This deck is really great. I love the Bluetooth functionality Great sound, great features! I bought this to replace a radio in an older car, thinking that I would just get something passable for Bluetooth connectivity, and music. What I got instead was a feature packed, economical head-unit, with amazing sound quality. It may not have a CD player on board, but who needs CDs anymore? :) Awesome Lovee this head unit. Tells me the song on the radio and I can control my music on my android phone. Make calls and everything. No need to look at phone when changing songs.

Great Bluetooth Speaker Great speaker for a great price! You will not find more bang for your buck. I guarantee it. AMAZING!! This is the best speaker I have ever owned. The sound is so clear and the highs and lows are amazing. I was lenient on buying a Sony product after so many bad Sony products in mid 2000, but I'm glad I took a chance. I will now be buying more Sony audio products as well as a new TV as I'm replacing my home theater. Awesome sound I went to bestbuy to buy a bose color 2. But I listened to the Sony and the bose wasn't even close.i gladly paid a little more for the Sony.the sound is expansive and just the right amount of base.and if near wifi I can load up Sony app and play music through wifi instead of Bluetooth. HD Sound in a small package Excellent Fidelity, great Battery life, Strong Bluetooth signal. Great sound I bought this product to listen to music around the house, kitchen, bathroom, garage etc....

11," Lasted 9 Months My problem was that the laptop was no longer charging. Purchased this Lenovo adapter and it worked at first. Now, nine months later, it is doing the same thing it did before. Works fine with Thinkpad X1 Carbon Touch I bought this to use as a travel adapter for my Thinkpad X1 Carbon Touch, and it works fine in that regard.I did, however, get caught off guard because this adapter uses a triple-pronged plug, not the two-prong that Thinkpad chargers generally come with. This makes the cord that comes with it a little bulkier than I expected and I wasn't able to use my extra-long two-prong cord. I didn't see this called out in the product description, so if you are often in a situation where you're dealing with ungrounded outlets, be aware. What I needed! This cable was the exact same one I needed for my Lenovo flex 15! Works fine with my Lenovo laptop X240 I have had problems with some adapters working with some of my previous laptops. This one works great with my Lenovo laptop X240. Warning! NOT Genuine! Crappy QC! I was in a rather desperate spot when my original laptop charger up and quit. Nabbed this one, and it seemed to work ok. After only a week or so, I now have the problem where it repeatedly stops and starts charging every few seconds when plugged in. Basically, the charger is useless to me.You may notice that this one costs 20 whereas the same thing from Lenovo, Best Buy etc. is in the 40+ range. There's a reason - this is a knockoff, despite the Lenovo labeling all over it. The biggest giveaway is that this one lacks a barcode - all Lenovo chargers should have a barcode which contains model number, serial number etc. but this one does not. There are probably other ways to tell this one is fake, but that was the most obvious.Perhaps these may work for some people. But if your laptop is essential for your life in general (as it is for me), then spend the extra and buy genuine. It's worth it. Genuine adapter/slim tip but not slim travel adapter The adapter I got works and appears to be a genuine Lenovo. It's 3-prong, but it's in the Lenovo FRU list for my machine (t440s). It's worth noting however that while the adapter I got has the new slim-tip connector, it is not a slim adapter - just a typical brick. The listing isn't exactly clear on this. Also worth noting that I ordered from Notebook Parts Outlet and received a 65W adapter due to stock issues with the 45W - not exactly what I was looking for due to weight reasons, but it works as well (and they refunded my shipping charges when questioned about this).

13," Memory Works as memory should and it worked with my Rizen processor. Great for building a gaming computer Just what was needed and works great for the new computer Good value Used 1 stick in each of my mining rigs. Decent price and could use 1 stick in each rig. Great! Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good, but first one hardware fault Theyre good, fast and doing exactly like they should. The first one had a hardware fault at about 17-20 days. I have 4 sticks all working well. Great memory My computer wasn't turning on. I got this RAM and it fired right up. Good DDR4 memory. exactly what I needed Perfect, Great Price, Exactly as advertised. !!!!! Made older computer so much better I'd been debating whether or not to upgrade our older (well, four years old) computer that is mainly used for gaming. It's been having problems with overclocking games especially when the graphics get very animated. In the middle of a big battle, having the screen freeze or pixilate makes a person want to chuck the keyboard across the room. After looking into the cost of upgrading the memory, video card, and processor versus the cost of a new tower, it was s bit of a toss up. When this DD4 memory became available, it was enough to sway my choice and I'm very glad I did. I though with a new video card and upgraded AMD processor games played much better, but with this new memory upgrade on board, WOW.These sticks are very easy to install, and I like that their open design helps to dissipate heat. They took just a few minutes to physically install and then a few more while the computer recognized and adapted to the upgrade. There are zero problems now with overclocking. Everything runs beautifully and smoothly, from Fallout 4 to crazy cat videos on the interwebs. I do wish that these sticks were 2x8GB so I could do four of those for 32GB, but I really can't complain as the computer works so much better now. Great Gamer Memory Good quality and functions well. Easy to install and sped up my PC. No Complaints Easy to install. Does what its supposed to do. Good price. No complaints. Great Great RAM for the price as usual it was easy to install. Great for more space I needed more speed and space for gaming and this was a great add. Great memory for the price Bought 2 of these while on sale. Great value for the money. Wrong they gave me the wrong ram and thank goodness i didnt break my computer. Fast RAM This is was a upgrade for my HP desktop went from 8 to 16 GIGs of RAM, supper fast response and has been a great help to online gaming. No issues installing and is straight plug and play. Fast Great ram. Very fast. Expensive but worth it if you need a quick upgrade Great RAM! Good performing RAM for the price. Easy to install. Make sure to set bios to work with the new speeds. Perfect I purchased this as extra memory for my Alienware PC. Easy to install, speed is spot on and these have good heatsinks!Would definitely buy again. Great RAM which can be found much cheaper in store I ran this RAM at 2133 MHz because at the time I had a 6th gen Intel processor. I really did not have any issues with the product except for the fact that on several non Z series mobos (MSI, Gygabyte) it would only run in single channel mode and unfortunately did not have a Intel XMP profile (really not a big deal if you research stable OC voltages and don't get hung up on stuff you don't need). But none the less I was able to play any game I wanted with ease. 16 GB at 2133 really is more than most people need and chances are if you are just beginning to build your own PC this will be an extremely good upgrade. It runs very fast, stable and most of all cool. I am posting some pics b18," Awesome Couldn't be happier with my purchase, completes the set! Great versatility Use it as direct speaker from tv or 2 as surround with sony sound bar. Great sound. It's ok, limited functionality I purchased this to extend surround sound, but it seems that you can only use wireless surround or wired, not both together. It also forgets if you have something connected to aux, so you have to continually change the input back. OK, expected a better speaker Sound it’s ok compare to my Harman Kodon Bluetooth speaker. It’s more connection options, but I could not get the Chromecast to connect with YouTube app. Great sound Quick to set up and sync with the television. Love the sound. Great TV and Speaker We are loving our new TV and speaker. So glad that the Geek squad wsa able to come to help us set things up. complete room system compliments my restroom and living room system. love it Good sound-Songpal app not close to Sonos Sony makes great sounding speakers, but the Songpal app needs update Sony Speaker I love Sony, this is just another one of their great products!

19," Nice Price I chose this one based on price. I've had other Toshiba drives in the past, and their return policy is odd, but it worked out OK.This drive runs hotter than the 2TB Seagate that it replaced, so you should be aware there will be about a 5 degree Celsius difference in heat output. This drive is also louder than the Seagate.The drive arrived as expected. It functions well. There were no cables nor screws included, so this is bare bones. not bad for the price there is some ups and downs as installing it physically was easy enough and it showed up in bios but not windows 7 disk mgmt. but with a little knowledge, it was a simple fix - again for the price - buy it Perfect for my workstation Used to be a Seagate fan for their 5 yrs warranty on Hard rives but started searching for other brands after Seagate reduced warranty to 1 and 2 years on general use hard drives. Started using Toshiba Hard drives since last 2 years and did not turn back. So far no problem with any of Toshiba Hard drives I have. Price is always lower if not lowest than other brands. This is my 2nd 3TB drive in 4 months, came in retail pack which is very important for me. For an anticipated preexisting drop injury to a hard drive, retail packaging lowers the risk of failing. This is not a green drive, it is designed for 24/7/365 use. I do not like green drives which turn off or spin down and when accessed they take time to comeback to speed. I use this large capacity drive for data and it is almost instantaneous when accessing data from this drive. Only negative is some clicking when accessed but it has not harmed me and I care about reliability more than these minor unimportant factors. I am very happy with Toshiba hard drives.

22," Heavy, bulky and not the best sound When I opened the package and felt the heft of this speaker, I was sure this was going to be a winner. After pairing it with my Ipod and playing the first song, the disappointment set in. The sound quality was not as clear or crisp as the Bose or UE Megablast. It may be a good party speaker with better sound at higher volumes, but it just didn't pass my sound test at normal volumes.

23," Very Nice Works Great and has a lot of features. Only downside is that it is not BLUTOOTH.... Pleased with my purchase. Works well. Would have given 5 stars if carplay was Bluetooth. Overall great Overall very happy with this product one issue I have found is trying to use the cell phone and GPS at the same time does not work every time. Because everything is ran off the phone Great raido Great with the iPhone 6 and it gives out great sound Great add-on for every car I drive a 2008 Porsche Cayman which has no option of connecting an iPhone to play music etc. which was the reason for looking in a lot of different options for my car and decided to go with the Alpine - 7"" - Apple iPod -Ready - In-Dash Deck - Black.I love how Apple Car Play works in general. It feels like using your iPhone directly in your car. The hands free talking works great and the microphone is providing good sound to the person on the other end of the line.There are a few things I want to mention that are useful to know before purchasing this system. It will only connect your phone via usb-lightning cable. There is no bluetooth option available for your iphone which I would prefer. I would also like Apple Car Play to come out with an update that integrates Apple Music and the availability to search for songs and play them. For iPhone enthusiasts Apple CarPlay is here and it's clean interface is what is going to attract many buyers. I do enjoy the fast and simple interface that functions almost exactly as any Apple product many have come to know. It is the sole reason I personally purchased the deck and overall am quite pleased with it. It is super basic which is understandable to keep the driver's eyes on the road and not the display. For music it's a home run and for navigation it's a bit of a disappointment. There is NO Bluetooth connectivity which is a bit of a bummer and the phone mirrors the app on the screen which is a negative in my opinion. Alpine quality is there, but it's far from perfect. Great radio with one flaw This unit is great for any Apple enthusiast and overall is a outstanding unit. The only downside is it requires a cable to connect to your iPhone. It would be great if it had wireless CarPlay. Simple radio I love the radio and all the features minus the fact you can't watch video on it and there's no multitasking. If you want maps open but someone texts you. The messenger opens and stays open till you close. If you could multitask it would be a lot better. Looks great Looking for another one. Just need to find one open box Great stereo love this alpine unit. It really beats buying a stock gps, not to mention that it looks better thin stock. Great stereo I purchased this a couple of months ago, has the features I wanted and the CarPlay works well with my I phone. DISAPPOINTED I HAD GREAT HOPES FOR THIS UNITUPON OPENING THE UNIT AND READING FURTHER ABOUT THE UNIT I DISCOVERED IT WAS NOT BLUETOOTHI RETURNED IT & EXCHANGED IT FOR A BLUETOOTH UNIT Great radio, But I wish it would pick up the Google Maps app instead of Apple Maps. It also skips radio stations I could pick up on my stock radio. That is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars. Good Good speaker product I really enjoy them. Crispy sound out of the kicker I would recommend them Love it! Wish I would have bought it sooner. I love it! It works great as the gps. The music app works well when touchingly have to tell Siri what you want to hear. Can't say enough OMG! Great Convenience while driving. Works easy and Effortless i love it .In my BMW2002 Great Sub Simply Awesome! A++++ this sub rocks. Fits perfectly in my boat, and sounds incredible. Just what I needed to get some thump. Amazing sound!! The sound amazing. They are crystal clear. You can hear the full range of music. Sounds good with everything from hip hop to heavy metal with a pounding double bass. It took a bit of work to hve them installed properly. It was worth it to take my time and do it right. I had to dremel the tweeter holes in my door but after much calculating and aiming, I don't think a professional couldve done any better.Very worth my investment Very Nice Works Great and has a lot of features.

24," all have been helpful and go all out for us all the we have had put in to our house have been king and pleasant to talk to and will do more business with you and have recommended to our friends not as good as the old one ! Cost more money and get less would Not buy the same pc ! Pretty Good Desktop for Photography, Web Apps This is my third XPS computer in 15 years. The first was powerful but had very noisy fans, my wife who shared my office said it sounded like a plane warming up for takeoff. The second XPS was quiet, but this third iteration seems to be edging back up in noise level though not anywhere near as annoying or loud as the first.I use the XPS computer for two main tasks: Photo editing in Lightroom and Photoshop. Managing online marketing using platforms like AdWords and Analytics. This model is easily up to the task in either case. Web platforms load quickly and photos transfer between programs at an acceptable speed.I would recommend 32 GB of memory as an upgrade, and the AMD Radeon RX560 video card is about the minimum usable for the Adobe products. Photoshop working on layered files needs lots of RAM, and Lightroom is heavily dependent on video GPU / video memory for processing speed. While the RX560 meets or exceeds Adobe's suggested video memory requirements, the card seems to under perform compared to the NVIDIA card I added to the previous computer.I would recommend the XPS series for nearly anyone, but I suggest that the off the shelf models can be improved with more memory and better video cards over time. If I had one wish it would be that Dell pick a RAM memory type and stick with it. I've purchased memory upgrades for my two previous XPS computers, and none of the previous sticks will fit into the next model computer. I know, memory technology improves over time too, but it's still aggravating to have 64GB of unusable memory sticks just laying around while this new computer is starved for more GB's. Fast Computer Like my new Dell Computer, loads quickly, very good response time, only fault was cheap keyboard so have a better keyboard, Dell upgrades their software which is a plus! Cheap cd player Not Dell's best effort. The whole thing feels cheap. nothing but problems...avoid dell xps i hav had 3 dell desktops and went to bu my 4th. Had nothing but problems. 14 crashes in about a weeks time.Best Buy and geek squad were wonderful with taking it back and helping me find a replacement .Bec there were problems with the one on the floor for demos I switched to an HP. Great machine at good cost ...XPS is a very good desktop tower that allows a good experience! Great machine! This computer was purchased to work on some light video editing and blog posting... working very well. Had some trouble with the Intel wireless adapter but a firmware update seems to have fixed that. Almost future proof Great for introduction to gaming. Design enables you to upgrade video card and possible add a solid state drive easily. You want room to grow and with YouTube assistance, the changes can be done yourself. Great computer for college students The computer is fast and very quiet. Start ups and restarts are so fast compared to my old computer. With the amount of RAM installed, there is no lag. I have not seen any thrashing or boot problems. Great choice Very nice computer but Network issues like others Computer will restart at random times. Explorer Edge won't reload at times and just stays blank. Will show connected to network but no internet connection and nothing will load. Must cut off and restart to get it to work again and then always gives an error code when shutting down for a restart or during the restart. Time to take it back and try something else I suppose. Faster than the previous Dell XPS It is quick, and was a good price from Best Buy. My former dell torched the mother board. Fortunately, Best Buy had one on the shelves. excellent computer This computer is extremely quick and has great storage and memory! We use this in the construction industry and needed something with space for bidding programs. It works wonderfully. Fast and reliable desktop Easy to install desktop computer ... lots of USB ports also. Great computer I bought this for my daughter and it is working great. Her old one has not been operating for about 2 years and I finally said that I would buy one. The only important items she had on her old one was her photos. I had the Geek Squad remove the hard drive and transfer all photos to the new computer.

25," Great basic headphones Got them for my grandkids to be compatible with my DVD player. They work great! This was just what I wanted. Cord-free! The reviews of this item were very good, which is why I chose it. I've been more than happy with it. It connects very easily to Bluetooth-enabled sources, such as my iPad and my iTouch, and these just have to be within thirty feet or so. Awesome bluetooth headphones for the price! I have been researching Over the Ear bluetooth headphones for some time. I work in an IT environment, if I'm not on conference calls then I'm listening to music to drown out surrounding noise while I work all day at a computer. Since I have to go back and forth from call to music I typically use the ear buds that came with my phone, that have a mic.I may be the only one, but earbuds get sooo uncomfortable after hours of use. I tried a Jawbone for about a day, can't do the bluetooth in ear either..Over the ear BT headphones prices vary so much and can get very expensive on top of that I don't know that I would like them.. I bought these because they were cheap as a test run... After about 4 hours at work I LOVE them. They drown out a majority of outside noise without completely blocking all sound. (Which is good if someone is calling your attention) Music sounds WAY better than I would have imagined for the price. Of course BT headphones in general have a way to go.. these are great. So far so good on conference calls, other callers can't even tell I'm on a headset!! That's better than my earbud mic!!!If you are hesitant to buy a bluetooth over the ear headphone set, start with this one. I will likely upgrade to higher quality set eventually.... but for now I'm 100% satisfied. They are comfortable to wear all day long! Also not to mention NO WIRES!The only slight flaw is they are smaller than your typical skull candy hesh or beats over the ear set. They fit my head/ears perfectly, but if you can you should look at them in the store or google pictures of them on someone - to make sure you like the way they look. better than ear buds These headphones are easy to set up with any blue tooth system. Sound is good and they have good battery life. Very nice product for the price. I would definitely recommend this to others. The sound is very nice. good quality sound with no wires! I've used this commuting on the train / bus and have my laptop messenger bag and a back pack I carry with me. It's so nice to not have to worry about wires when putting all that on and off. The sound quality is really good as well. My only complaint is that after 60 minutes or so it does start to get uncomfortable, not unbearably so, but I do wish it had a softer plastic for the earpiece. It's easy to pair up with a blue tooth device. I use it with my cell phone and tablet. Great Deal For The $$$$$ Great Deal For the $$$$! I don’t have the best hearing, but this sounds great and it’s very easy to pair with my iPad, and not having to deal with hanging audio cables when I travel on an airplane is a big plus. Overall, I’m glad I did not give in to the $300 -$400 they’re asking for the other brands. Awesome wireless headphones These headphones are comfortable, sound great and can be used to talk on iPhone. I can lounge on the deck and no longer be choked by a wire! I've gone wireless This headphone doesn't state noise canceling, but the surrounding noise is really dampened when I put these on even before any other audio is streaming. I haven't used the built in microphone thus far but I do like listening to my videos and music with the cushioned ear pads instead of the in-ear buds. Great headphones for the price These headphones are a great value. They have very good sound. Not as good as Bose but still good. Being that they were $150 cheaper than Bose or Beats, it is an EXCELLENT value. I highly recommend. Not to mention the battery life is great. I charge them on Monday and they are fine until the weekend for lots of use. Plus they do have a microphone for phone calls also. Great deal! Killer bluetooth headphones These are exceptional bluetooth headphones. They sound superb. Great and even sound thru-out the entire spectrum. They paired up to my iPhone 5 no problem and always connect with ease. They look and feel fantastic and they are well made. No need to spend a fortune on headphones. These are the ones Simple and Excellent Sound Initially bought these for gaming so that I could chat with friends (on Ventrillo) and not have that cable drooping over my arms. Didn't work out. But the more I researched I found that it wasn't the headphones fault, it was Bluetooth in general. Bluetooth won't process a microphone in mono and stereo audio at the same time. The result is using your device in pure mono. Not so great. Again, not the headsets fault. So with this in mind, I don't game with the device using Bluetooth, I use my other wired gaming headset.All that aside, I love this headset. It was only $59, and I use it daily. I use it for my Galaxy Note 8, PC, Motorola Droid Razr Maxx when I'm not home, and at the gym.The fit is just right for my head, and I like how it's very light. I don't feel like I have a giant headset on that can come flying off If I move my head to quickly.The sound is superb, I was extremely surprised how good the bass was. I typically listen to Hip Hop and House music, so that was key for me. I bought these online, so I was worried they would not meet my needs. But they did.The Bluetooth connection is decent. Although, my other headsets have not been any better. I imagine this is probably related to the fact that my entire house is wireless. My wife and two kids use tablets daily, their gaming consoles are wireless, in addition to their laptops and my wifes PC. That combined with our wireless Smart TV's, and wireless stereos in the bathrooms... we have alot of RF floating around in the house. I'll cut this a break. I can typically walk about 30' away before it starts to break up. Although, I think this is the maximum that the FCC will allow, so no heartache there.The device pairs quite easily, and I use it on several devices, so I don't have any complaints in this department.Battery life is actually really good. I can go 3 days or so using it for about 4 hours a day. I don't let them sit on the charger when not in use, because that is probably bad for any device. When I go to charge them, the connect is bad, so I have to let the headphones sit at an angle on top of the connector so that it gets a good connection and charges. I'm sure it's the cable and not the headset, as the headset comes with a wired cable so that you can use this headset in wired mode.Using the headset in wired mode is a really nice feature, as if I'm low on charge I don't have to seek out a new headset.The headset also folds up for easy storing, and they provide a nice little felt bag in case you need to pack these up for traveling. Nice touch if you ask me.That's my review, hope this helps somebody out.I highly recommend these if you're looking for a headset that is cheap and really meets these primary needs:Great SoundEasy to Pair to multiple devicesLong life and charges using a USB plugFolds up for easy packingComfortable fit Not good for active person. Slips & comes off. Not what I wanted to use running & working out. It will not stay on with any movement. Works as advertised So far these headphones have been working well. Easy set up and connected to multiple devices without issue (one at a time). They stay on when running and exercising. The battery life is suitable. The only issue I have is they are sweat sponges. No odor issues yet but I imagine they will come with time, and no way that I can see of cleaning them, or repairing IF sweat causes damage. It is enough for me, but some may not like the lower volume limit. I like them and think the price was right for the product (purchased as deal of the day). Love it As someone who is not normally a fan of on ear headphones, and these being the first pair of wireless bluetooth headphones I tried, I initially didn't have very high expectations, however the connectivity and clear sound of these headphones really did blow me away. I use them around the house to listen to audio books and podcasts so I do not disturb others and the freedom of going wireless is great! excellent wireless headphones I love these wireless headphones, I use them everyday, my partner complained about trying to sleep while I watched TV late at night, since I ordered these no more complaints Great value! Bought these for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them. Great price for wireless headphones. Good sound too! Kids LOVE this My two sons love this so much. My oldest bought this with his birthday money (11 yrs old) and now he wears them all day everyday which leaves his hands free and no iPod or tablet tied to earbuds causing accidents while he does his chores around the house. He started using google voice from his tablet and can talk on the ""virtual"" phone with these headphones. It's pretty amazing. My 2nd son, decided that these we so cool that he also used his birthday money to buy himself a set in blue. It's just a matter of time before all three have a pair! Awesome headphones loved it for the price.. I never care to pen down for a review but these headphones are exceptional... Love them right from the day one... Very... Very happy with the purchase...!! A Bluetooth Headphone Bargain These headphones pair immediately with bluetooth equipment, fold up with a carry bag for easy portability, and have a nice, clear sound. These are a great deal compared to the cost of some of the bluetooth headphones on the market. great bluetooth headphone for the price ! Great headphones (bluetooth) for the price and hold charge for hours of listening. Great pair of headphones These headphones hit all the check marks of my little man's have to list. All came at a great price too Excellent headphones - use them all the time! I ordered these headphones after being totally disappointed in the ARCTIC Sound ORACO-ERM28-GBA01 Headphones P311 (Black and Gray), which I had ordered and returned earlier. See the 1-star reviews for the Arctic headphones here - http://www.amazon.com/ARCTIC-Sound-ORACO-ERM28-GBA01-Headphones-Black/product-reviews/B0040Z1EHY/refcmcrprtoplink1ieUTF8showViewpoints0filterByaddOneStarUnlike those, these started and paired up with my iPad and iPod right out of the gate, once I had charged them to full as recommended at startup. Since then, I have used them in all kinds of situations and find that they work excellently everywhere, without skipping. I have used them on long walks, on my commute through NYC's subway system, and at home. Mostly pros in the headphone. The only con (and this is true of all wireless headphones) is that the bass is not as deep or booming as on a wired headphone.Pros - instant connection with my various Bluetooth devices good battery life no skipping while walking or in the gym clear music streaming great comfort and fit good sound isolation - not active noise cancelation, but this sound isolation enables one to listen to music or talks at volumes that are not too high even in a NYC subway while listening to music, even people standing next to you cannot overhear it (which is a HUGE thing for me, as I detest having to listen to other people's screeching music while commuting) controls for volume, skipping tracks and pairing on the headphones are easy to use and logically placed.I would have liked the ability to turn my iPod or iPad on or off from the headset itself, but maybe that is not technologically feasible, I don't know.Highly recommend these headphones for purchase. Great basic headphones Got them for my grandkids to be compatible with my DVD player. They work great! This was just what I wanted. Cord-free! The reviews of this item were very good, which is why I chose it. I've been more than happy with it. It connects very easily to Bluetooth-enabled sources, such as my iPad and my iTouch, and these just have to be within thirty feet or so. Awesome bluetooth headphones for the price! I have been researching Over the Ear bluetooth headphones for some time. I work in an IT environment, if I'm not on conference calls then I'm listening to music to drown out surrounding noise while I work all day at a computer. Since I have to go back and forth from call to music I typically use the ear buds that came with my phone, that have a mic.I may be the only one, but earbuds get sooo uncomfortable after hours of use. I tried a Jawbone for about a day, can't do the bluetooth in ear either..Over the ear BT headphones prices vary so much and can get very expensive on top of that I don't know that I would like them.. I bought these because they were cheap as a test run... After about 4 hours at work I LOVE them. They drown out a majority of outside noise without completely blocking all sound. (Which is good if someone is calling your attention) Music sounds WAY better than I would have imagined for the price. Of course BT headphones in general have a way to go.. these are great. So far so good on conference calls, other callers can't even tell I'm on a headset!! That's better than my earbud mic!!!If you are hesitant to buy a bluetooth over the ear headphone set, start with this one. I will likely upgrade to higher quality set eventually.... but for now I'm 100% satisfied. They are comfortable to wear all day long! Also not to mention NO WIRES!The only slight flaw is they are smaller than your typical skull candy hesh or beats over the ear set. They fit my head/ears perfectly, but if you can you should look at them in the store or google pictures of them on someone - to make sure you like the way they look. better than ear buds These headphones are easy to set up with any blue tooth system. Sound is good and they have good battery life. Very nice product for the price. I would definitely recommend this to others. The sound is very nice. good quality sound with no wires! I've used this commuting on the train / bus and have my laptop messenger bag and a back pack I carry with me. It's so nice to not have to worry about wires when putting all that on and off. The sound quality is really good as well. My only complaint is that after 60 minutes or so it does start to get uncomfortable, not unbearably so, but I do wish it had a softer plastic for the earpiece. It's easy to pair up with a blue tooth device. I use it with my cell phone and tablet. Great Deal For The $$$$$ Great Deal For the $$$$! I don’t have the best hearing, but this sounds great and it’s very easy to pair with my iPad, and not having to deal with hanging audio cables when I travel on an airplane is a big plus. Overall, I’m glad I did not give in to the $300 -$400 they’re asking for the other brands. Awesome wireless headphones These headphones are comfortable, sound great and can be used to talk on iPhone. I can lounge on the deck and no longer be choked by a wire! I've gone wireless This headphone doesn't state noise canceling, but the surrounding noise is really dampened when I put these on even before any other audio is streaming. I haven't used the built in microphone thus far but I do like listening to my videos and music with the cushioned ear pads instead of the in-ear buds. Great headphones for the price These headphones are a great value. They have very good sound. Not as good as Bose but still good. Being that they were $150 cheaper than Bose or Beats, it is an EXCELLENT value. I highly recommend. Not to mention the battery life is great. I charge them on Monday and they are fine until the weekend for lots of use. Plus they do have a microphone for phone calls also. Great deal! Killer bluetooth headphones These are exceptional bluetooth headphones. They sound superb. Great and even sound thru-out the entire spectrum. They paired up to my iPhone 5 no problem and always connect with ease. They look and feel fantastic and they are well made. No need to spend a fortune on headphones. These are the ones Simple and Excellent Sound Initially bought these for gaming so that I could chat with friends (on Ventrillo) and not have that cable drooping over my arms. Didn't work out. But the more I researched I found that it wasn't the headphones fault, it was Bluetooth in general. Bluetooth won't process a microphone in mono and stereo audio at the same time. The result is using your device in pure mono. Not so great. Again, not the headsets fault. So with this in mind, I don't game with the device using Bluetooth, I use my other wired gaming headset.All that aside, I love this headset. It was only $59, and I use it daily. I use it for my Galaxy Note 8, PC, Motorola Droid Razr Maxx when I'm not home, and at the gym.The fit is just right for my head, and I like how it's very light. I don't feel like I have a giant headset on that can come flying off If I move my head to quickly.The sound is superb, I was extremely surprised how good the bass was. I typically listen to Hip Hop and House music, so that was key for me. I bought these online, so I was worried they would not meet my needs. But they did.The Bluetooth connection is decent. Although, my other headsets have not been any better. I imagine this is probably related to the fact that my entire house is wireless. My wife and two kids use tablets daily, their gaming consoles are wireless, in addition to their laptops and my wifes PC. That combined with our wireless Smart TV's, and wireless stereos in the bathrooms... we have alot of RF floating around in the house. I'll cut this a break. I can typically walk about 30' away before it starts to break up. Although, I think this is the maximum that the FCC will allow, so no heartache there.The device pairs quite easily, and I use it on several devices, so I don't have any complaints in this department.Battery life is actually really good. I can go 3 days or so using it for about 4 hours a day. I don't let them sit on the charger when not in use, because that is probably bad for any device. When I go to charge them, the connect is bad, so I have to let the headphones sit at an angle on top of the connector so that it gets a good connection and charges. I'm sure it's the cable and not the headset, as the headset comes with a wired cable so that you can use this headset in wired mode.Using the headset in wired mode is a really nice feature, as if I'm low on charge I don't have to seek out a new headset.The headset also folds up for easy storing, and they provide a nice little felt bag in case you need to pack these up for traveling. Nice touch if you ask me.That's my review, hope this helps somebody out.I highly recommend these if you're looking for a headset that is cheap and really meets these primary needs:Great SoundEasy to Pair to multiple devicesLong life and charges using a USB plugFolds up for easy packingComfortable fit Not good for active person. Slips & comes off. Not what I wanted to use running & working out. It will not stay on with any movement. Works as advertised So far these headphones have been working well. Easy set up and connected to multiple devices without issue (one at a time). They stay on when running and exercising. The battery life is suitable. The only issue I have is they are sweat sponges. No odor issues yet but I imagine they will come with time, and no way that I can see of cleaning them, or repairing IF sweat causes damage. It is enough for me, but some may not like the lower volume limit. I like them and think the price was right for the product (purchased as deal of the day). Love it As someone who is not normally a fan of on ear headphones, and these being the first pair of wireless bluetooth headphones I tried, I initially didn't have very high expectations, however the connectivity and clear sound of these headphones really did blow me away. I use them around the house to listen to audio books and podcasts so I do not disturb others and the freedom of going wireless is great! excellent wireless headphones I love these wireless headphones, I use them everyday, my partner complained about trying to sleep while I watched TV late at night, since I ordered these no more complaints Great value! Bought these for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them. Great price for wireless headphones. Good sound too! Kids LOVE this My two sons love this so much. My oldest bought this with his birthday money (11 yrs old) and now he wears them all day everyday which leaves his hands free and no iPod or tablet tied to earbuds causing accidents while he does his chores around the house. He started using google voice from his tablet and can talk on the ""virtual"" phone with these headphones. It's pretty amazing. My 2nd son, decided that these we so cool that he also used his birthday money to buy himself a set in blue. It's just a matter of time before all three have a pair!

Great versatility Use it as direct speaker from tv or 2 as surround with sony sound bar. Great sound. It's ok, limited functionality I purchased this to extend surround sound, but it seems that you can only use wireless surround or wired, not both together. It also forgets if you have something connected to aux, so you have to continually change the input back. OK, expected a better speaker Sound it’s ok compare to my Harman Kodon Bluetooth speaker. It’s more connection options, but I could not get the Chromecast to connect with YouTube app. Great sound Quick to set up and sync with the television. Love the sound.

19," Nice Price I chose this one based on price. I've had other Toshiba drives in the past, and their return policy is odd, but it worked out OK.This drive runs hotter than the 2TB Seagate that it replaced, so you should be aware there will be about a 5 degree Celsius difference in heat output. This drive is also louder than the Seagate.The drive arrived as expected. It functions well. There were no cables nor screws included, so this is bare bones. not bad for the price there is some ups and downs as installing it physically was easy enough and it showed up in bios but not windows 7 disk mgmt. but with a little knowledge, it was a simple fix - again for the price - buy it Perfect for my workstation Used to be a Seagate fan for their 5 yrs warranty on Hard rives but started searching for other brands after Seagate reduced warranty to 1 and 2 years on general use hard drives. Started using Toshiba Hard drives since last 2 years and did not turn back. So far no problem with any of Toshiba Hard drives I have. Price is always lower if not lowest than other brands. This is my 2nd 3TB drive in 4 months, came in retail pack which is very important for me. For an anticipated preexisting drop injury to a hard drive, retail packaging lowers the risk of failing. This is not a green drive, it is designed for 24/7/365 use. I do not like green drives which turn off or spin down and when accessed they take time to comeback to speed. I use this large capacity drive for data and it is almost instantaneous when accessing data from this drive. Only negative is some clicking when accessed but it has not harmed me and I care about reliability more than these minor unimportant factors. I am very happy with Toshiba hard drives.

22," Heavy, bulky and not the best sound When I opened the package and felt the heft of this speaker, I was sure this was going to be a winner. After pairing it with my Ipod and playing the first song, the disappointment set in. The sound quality was not as clear or crisp as the Bose or UE Megablast. It may be a good party speaker with better sound at higher volumes, but it just didn't pass my sound test at normal volumes.

23," Very Nice Works Great and has a lot of features. Only downside is that it is not BLUTOOTH.... Pleased with my purchase. Works well. Would have given 5 stars if carplay was Bluetooth. Overall great Overall very happy with this product one issue I have found is trying to use the cell phone and GPS at the same time does not work every time. Because everything is ran off the phone Great raido Great with the iPhone 6 and it gives out great sound Great add-on for every car I drive a 2008 Porsche Cayman which has no option of connecting an iPhone to play music etc. which was the reason for looking in a lot of different options for my car and decided to go with the Alpine - 7"" - Apple iPod -Ready - In-Dash Deck - Black.I love how Apple Car Play works in general. It feels like using your iPhone directly in your car. The hands free talking works great and the microphone is providing good sound to the person on the other end of the line.There are a few things I want to mention that are useful to know before purchasing this system. It will only connect your phone via usb-lightning cable. There is no bluetooth option available for your iphone which I would prefer. I would also like Apple Car Play to come out with an update that integrates Apple Music and the availability to search for songs and play them. For iPhone enthusiasts Apple CarPlay is here and it's clean interface is what is going to attract many buyers. I do enjoy the fast and simple interface that functions almost exactly as any Apple product many have come to know. It is the sole reason I personally purchased the deck and overall am quite pleased with it. It is super basic which is understandable to keep the driver's eyes on the road and not the display. For music it's a home run and for navigation it's a bit of a disappointment. There is NO Bluetooth connectivity which is a bit of a bummer and the phone mirrors the app on the screen which is a negative in my opinion. Alpine quality is there, but it's far from perfect. Great radio with one flaw This unit is great for any Apple enthusiast and overall is a outstanding unit. The only downside is it requires a cable to connect to your iPhone. It would be great if it had wireless CarPlay. Simple radio I love the radio and all the features minus the fact you can't watch video on it and there's no multitasking. If you want maps open but someone texts you. The messenger opens and stays open till you close. If you could multitask it would be a lot better. Looks great Looking for another one. Just need to find one open box Great stereo love this alpine unit. It really beats buying a stock gps, not to mention that it looks better thin stock. Great stereo I purchased this a couple of months ago, has the features I wanted and the CarPlay works well with my I phone. DISAPPOINTED I HAD GREAT HOPES FOR THIS UNITUPON OPENING THE UNIT AND READING FURTHER ABOUT THE UNIT I DISCOVERED IT WAS NOT BLUETOOTHI RETURNED IT & EXCHANGED IT FOR A BLUETOOTH UNIT Great radio, But I wish it would pick up the Google Maps app instead of Apple Maps. It also skips radio stations I could pick up on my stock radio. That is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars. Good Good speaker product I really enjoy them. Crispy sound out of the kicker I would recommend them Love it! Wish I would have bought it sooner. I love it! It works great as the gps. The music app works well when touchingly have to tell Siri what you want to hear. Can't say enough OMG! Great Convenience while driving. Works easy and Effortless i love it .In my BMW2002 Great Sub Simply Awesome! A++++ this sub rocks. Fits perfectly in my boat, and sounds incredible. Just what I needed to get some thump. Amazing sound!! The sound amazing. They are crystal clear. You can hear the full range of music. Sounds good with everything from hip hop to heavy metal with a pounding double bass. It took a bit of work to hve them installed properly. It was worth it to take my time and do it right. I had to dremel the tweeter holes in my door but after much calculating and aiming, I don't think a professional couldve done any better.Very worth my investment Very Nice Works Great and has a lot of features.

24," all have been helpful and go all out for us all the we have had put in to our house have been king and pleasant to talk to and will do more business with you and have recommended to our friends not as good as the old one ! Cost more money and get less would Not buy the same pc ! Pretty Good Desktop for Photography, Web Apps This is my third XPS computer in 15 years. The first was powerful but had very noisy fans, my wife who shared my office said it sounded like a plane warming up for takeoff. The second XPS was quiet, but this third iteration seems to be edging back up in noise level though not anywhere near as annoying or loud as the first.I use the XPS computer for two main tasks: Photo editing in Lightroom and Photoshop. Managing online marketing using platforms like AdWords and Analytics. This model is easily up to the task in either case. Web platforms load quickly and photos transfer between programs at an acceptable speed.I would recommend 32 GB of memory as an upgrade, and the AMD Radeon RX560 video card is about the minimum usable for the Adobe products. Photoshop working on layered files needs lots of RAM, and Lightroom is heavily dependent on video GPU / video memory for processing speed. While the RX560 meets or exceeds Adobe's suggested video memory requirements, the card seems to under perform compared to the NVIDIA card I added to the previous computer.I would recommend the XPS series for nearly anyone, but I suggest that the off the shelf models can be improved with more memory and better video cards over time. If I had one wish it would be that Dell pick a RAM memory type and stick with it. I've purchased memory upgrades for my two previous XPS computers, and none of the previous sticks will fit into the next model computer. I know, memory technology improves over time too, but it's still aggravating to have 64GB of unusable memory sticks just laying around while this new computer is starved for more GB's. Fast Computer Like my new Dell Computer, loads quickly, very good response time, only fault was cheap keyboard so have a better keyboard, Dell upgrades their software which is a plus! Cheap cd player Not Dell's best effort. The whole thing feels cheap. nothing but problems...avoid dell xps i hav had 3 dell desktops and went to bu my 4th. Had nothing but problems. 14 crashes in about a weeks time.Best Buy and geek squad were wonderful with taking it back and helping me find a replacement .Bec there were problems with the one on the floor for demos I switched to an HP. Great machine at good cost ...XPS is a very good desktop tower that allows a good experience! Great machine! This computer was purchased to work on some light video editing and blog posting... working very well. Had some trouble with the Intel wireless adapter but a firmware update seems to have fixed that. Almost future proof Great for introduction to gaming. Design enables you to upgrade video card and possible add a solid state drive easily. You want room to grow and with YouTube assistance, the changes can be done yourself. Great computer for college students The computer is fast and very quiet. Start ups and restarts are so fast compared to my old computer. With the amount of RAM installed, there is no lag. I have not seen any thrashing or boot problems. Great choice Very nice computer but Network issues like others Computer will restart at random times. Explorer Edge won't reload at times and just stays blank. Will show connected to network but no internet connection and nothing will load. Must cut off and restart to get it to work again and then always gives an error code when shutting down for a restart or during the restart. Time to take it back and try something else I suppose. Faster than the previous Dell XPS It is quick, and was a good price from Best Buy. My former dell torched the mother board. Fortunately, Best Buy had one on the shelves. excellent computer This computer is extremely quick and has great storage and memory! We use this in the construction industry and needed something with space for bidding programs. It works wonderfully. Fast and reliable desktop Easy to install desktop computer ... lots of USB ports also. Great computer I bought this for my daughter and it is working great. Her old one has not been operating for about 2 years and I finally said that I would buy one. The only important items she had on her old one was her photos. I had the Geek Squad remove the hard drive and transfer all photos to the new computer. Thank goodness it still worked. outstanding lights outs pc! excellent speed, used for business all have been helpful and go all out for us all the we have had put in to our house have been king and pleasant to talk to and will do more business with you and have recommended to our friends not as good as the old one !

I've purchased memory upgrades for my two previous XPS computers, and none of the previous sticks will fit into the next model computer. I know, memory technology improves over time too, but it's still aggravating to have 64GB of unusable memory sticks just laying around while this new computer is starved for more GB's. Fast Computer Like my new Dell Computer, loads quickly, very good response time, only fault was cheap keyboard so have a better keyboard, Dell upgrades their software which is a plus! Cheap cd player Not Dell's best effort. The whole thing feels cheap. nothing but problems...avoid dell xps i hav had 3 dell desktops and went to bu my 4th. Had nothing but problems. 14 crashes in about a weeks time.Best Buy and geek squad were wonderful with taking it back and helping me find a replacement .Bec there were problems with the one on the floor for demos I switched to an HP. Great machine at good cost ...XPS is a very good desktop tower that allows a good experience! Great machine! This computer was purchased to work on some light video editing and blog posting... working very well. Had some trouble with the Intel wireless adapter but a firmware update seems to have fixed that. Almost future proof Great for introduction to gaming. Design enables you to upgrade video card and possible add a solid state drive easily. You want room to grow and with YouTube assistance, the changes can be done yourself. Great computer for college students The computer is fast and very quiet. Start ups and restarts are so fast compared to my old computer. With the amount of RAM installed, there is no lag. I have not seen any thrashing or boot problems. Great choice Very nice computer but Network issues like others Computer will restart at random times. Explorer Edge won't reload at times and just stays blank. Will show connected to network but no internet connection and nothing will load. Must cut off and restart to get it to work again and then always gives an error code when shutting down for a restart or during the restart. Time to take it back and try something else I suppose. Faster than the previous Dell XPS It is quick, and was a good price from Best Buy. My former dell torched the mother board. Fortunately, Best Buy had one on the shelves. excellent computer This computer is extremely quick and has great storage and memory! We use this in the construction industry and needed something with space for bidding programs. It works wonderfully. Fast and reliable desktop Easy to install desktop computer ... lots of USB ports also. Great computer I bought this for my daughter and it is working great. Her old one has not been operating for about 2 years and I finally said that I would buy one. The only important items she had on her old one was her photos. I had the Geek Squad remove the hard drive and transfer all photos to the new computer. Thank goodness it still worked. outstanding lights outs pc! excellent speed, used for business"
25," Great basic headphones Got them for my grandkids to be compatible with my DVD player. They work great! This was just what I wanted. Cord-free! The reviews of this item were very good, which is why I chose it. I've been more than happy with it. It connects very easily to Bluetooth-enabled sources, such as my iPad and my iTouch, and these just have to be within thirty feet or so. Awesome bluetooth headphones for the price! I have been researching Over the Ear bluetooth headphones for some time. I work in an IT environment, if I'm not on conference calls then I'm listening to music to drown out surrounding noise while I work all day at a computer. Since I have to go back and forth from call to music I typically use the ear buds that came with my phone, that have a mic.I may be the only one, but earbuds get sooo uncomfortable after hours of use. I tried a Jawbone for about a day, can't do the bluetooth in ear either..Over the ear BT headphones prices vary so much and can get very expensive on top of that I don't know that I would like them.. I bought these because they were cheap as a test run... After about 4 hours at work I LOVE them. They drown out a majority of outside noise without completely blocking all sound. (Which is good if someone is calling your attention) Music sounds WAY better than I would have imagined for the price. Of course BT headphones in general have a way to go.. these are great. So far so good on conference calls, other callers can't even tell I'm on a headset!! That's better than my earbud mic!!!If you are hesitant to buy a bluetooth over the ear headphone set, start with this one. I will likely upgrade to higher quality set eventually.... but for now I'm 100% satisfied. They are comfortable to wear all day long! Also not to mention NO WIRES!The only slight flaw is they are smaller than your typical skull candy hesh or beats over the ear set. They fit my head/ears perfectly, but if you can you should look at them in the store or google pictures of them on someone - to make sure you like the way they look. better than ear buds These headphones are easy to set up with any blue tooth system. Sound is good and they have good battery life. Very nice product for the price. I would definitely recommend this to others. The sound is very nice. good quality sound with no wires! I've used this commuting on the train / bus and have my laptop messenger bag and a back pack I carry with me. It's so nice to not have to worry about wires when putting all that on and off. The sound quality is really good as well. My only complaint is that after 60 minutes or so it does start to get uncomfortable, not unbearably so, but I do wish it had a softer plastic for the earpiece. It's easy to pair up with a blue tooth device. I use it with my cell phone and tablet. Great Deal For The $$$$$ Great Deal For the $$$$! I don’t have the best hearing, but this sounds great and it’s very easy to pair with my iPad, and not having to deal with hanging audio cables when I travel on an airplane is a big plus. Overall, I’m glad I did not give in to the $300 -$400 they’re asking for the other brands. Awesome wireless headphones These headphones are comfortable, sound great and can be used to talk on iPhone. I can lounge on the deck and no longer be choked by a wire! I've gone wireless This headphone doesn't state noise canceling, but the surrounding noise is really dampened when I put these on even before any other audio is streaming. I haven't used the built in microphone thus far but I do like listening to my videos and music with the cushioned ear pads instead of the in-ear buds. Great headphones for the price These headphones are a great value. They have very good sound. Not as good as Bose but still good. Being that they were $150 cheaper than Bose or Beats, it is an EXCELLENT value. I highly recommend. Not to mention the battery life is great. I charge them on Monday and they are fine until the weekend for lots of use. Plus they do have a microphone for phone calls also. Great deal! Killer bluetooth headphones These are exceptional bluetooth headphones. They sound superb. Great and even sound thru-out the entire spectrum. They paired up to my iPhone 5 no problem and always connect with ease. They look and feel fantastic and they are well made. No need to spend a fortune on headphones. These are the ones Simple and Excellent Sound Initially bought these for gaming so that I could chat with friends (on Ventrillo) and not have that cable drooping over my arms. Didn't work out. But the more I researched I found that it wasn't the headphones fault, it was Bluetooth in general. Bluetooth won't process a microphone in mono and stereo audio at the same time. The result is using your device in pure mono. Not so great. Again, not the headsets fault. So with this in mind, I don't game with the device using Bluetooth, I use my other wired gaming headset.All that aside, I love this headset. It was only $59, and I use it daily. I use it for my Galaxy Note 8, PC, Motorola Droid Razr Maxx when I'm not home, and at the gym.The fit is just right for my head, and I like how it's very light. I don't feel like I have a giant headset on that can come flying off If I move my head to quickly.The sound is superb, I was extremely surprised how good the bass was. I typically listen to Hip Hop and House music, so that was key for me. I bought these online, so I was worried they would not meet my needs. But they did.The Bluetooth connection is decent. Although, my other headsets have not been any better. I imagine this is probably related to the fact that my entire house is wireless. My wife and two kids use tablets daily, their gaming consoles are wireless, in addition to their laptops and my wifes PC. That combined with our wireless Smart TV's, and wireless stereos in the bathrooms... we have alot of RF floating around in the house. I'll cut this a break. I can typically walk about 30' away before it starts to break up. Although, I think this is the maximum that the FCC will allow, so no heartache there.The device pairs quite easily, and I use it on several devices, so I don't have any complaints in this department.Battery life is actually really good. I can go 3 days or so using it for about 4 hours a day. I don't let them sit on the charger when not in use, because that is probably bad for any device. When I go to charge them, the connect is bad, so I have to let the headphones sit at an angle on top of the connector so that it gets a good connection and charges. I'm sure it's the cable and not the headset, as the headset comes with a wired cable so that you can use this headset in wired mode.Using the headset in wired mode is a really nice feature, as if I'm low on charge I don't have to seek out a new headset.The headset also folds up for easy storing, and they provide a nice little felt bag in case you need to pack these up for traveling. Nice touch if you ask me.That's my review, hope this helps somebody out.I highly recommend these if you're looking for a headset that is cheap and really meets these primary needs:Great SoundEasy to Pair to multiple devicesLong life and charges using a USB plugFolds up for easy packingComfortable fit Not good for active person. Slips & comes off. Not what I wanted to use running & working out. It will not stay on with any movement. Works as advertised So far these headphones have been working well. Easy set up and connected to multiple devices without issue (one at a time). They stay on when running and exercising. The battery life is suitable. The only issue I have is they are sweat sponges. No odor issues yet but I imagine they will come with time, and no way that I can see of cleaning them, or repairing IF sweat causes damage. It is enough for me, but some may not like the lower volume limit. I like them and think the price was right for the product (purchased as deal of the day). Love it As someone who is not normally a fan of on ear headphones, and these being the first pair of wireless bluetooth headphones I tried, I initially didn't have very high expectations, however the connectivity and clear sound of these headphones really did blow me away. I use them around the house to listen to audio books and podcasts so I do not disturb others and the freedom of going wireless is great! excellent wireless headphones I love these wireless headphones, I use them everyday, my partner complained about trying to sleep while I watched TV late at night, since I ordered these no more complaints Great value! Bought these for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them. Great price for wireless headphones. Good sound too! Kids LOVE this My two sons love this so much. My oldest bought this with his birthday money (11 yrs old) and now he wears them all day everyday which leaves his hands free and no iPod or tablet tied to earbuds causing accidents while he does his chores around the house. He started using google voice from his tablet and can talk on the ""virtual"" phone with these headphones. It's pretty amazing. My 2nd son, decided that these we so cool that he also used his birthday money to buy himself a set in blue. It's just a matter of time before all three have a pair! Awesome headphones loved it for the price.. I never care to pen down for a review but these headphones are exceptional... Love them right from the day one... Very... Very happy with the purchase...!! A Bluetooth Headphone Bargain These headphones pair immediately with bluetooth equipment, fold up with a carry bag for easy portability, and have a nice, clear sound. These are a great deal compared to the cost of some of the bluetooth headphones on the market. great bluetooth headphone for the price ! Great headphones (bluetooth) for the price and hold charge for hours of listening. Great pair of headphones These headphones hit all the check marks of my little man's have to list. All came at a great price too Excellent headphones - use them all the time! I ordered these headphones after being totally disappointed in the ARCTIC Sound ORACO-ERM28-GBA01 Headphones P311 (Black and Gray), which I had ordered and returned earlier. See the 1-star reviews for the Arctic headphones here - http://www.amazon.com/ARCTIC-Sound-ORACO-ERM28-GBA01-Headphones-Black/product-reviews/B0040Z1EHY/refcmcrprtoplink1ieUTF8showViewpoints0filterByaddOneStarUnlike those, these started and paired up with my iPad and iPod right out of the gate, once I had charged them to full as recommended at startup. Since then, I have used them in all kinds of situations and find that they work excellently everywhere, without skipping. I have used them on long walks, on my commute through NYC's subway system, and at home. Mostly pros in the headphone. The only con (and this is true of all wireless headphones) is that the bass is not as deep or booming as on a wired headphone.Pros - instant connection with my various Bluetooth devices good battery life no skipping while walking or in the gym clear music streaming great comfort and fit good sound isolation - not active noise cancelation, but this sound isolation enables one to listen to music or talks at volumes that are not too high even in a NYC subway while listening to music, even people standing next to you cannot overhear it (which is a HUGE thing for me, as I detest having to listen to other people's screeching music while commuting) controls for volume, skipping tracks and pairing on the headphones are easy to use and logically placed.I would have liked the ability to turn my iPod or iPad on or off from the headset itself, but maybe that is not technologically feasible, I don't know.Highly recommend these headphones for purchase.

The speaker system is very easy to set up. You have to purchase wall mounting brackets separately for the surround speakers. Use Caution!!! First I had to wait to have this product shipped to the store near me since that store did not carry them. When I finally got the speakers, they did not work! This item does not include some kind of receiver or remote and if you want to mount the speakers to the wall or hook them up to some stands then you are going to have to purchase special adapters for each speaker that costs about $35-45 for ea speaker! Horrible experience so I returned this product and got some Klipsch speakers instead and now I'm happy! Is anything better than Bose?? Love, love, love these speakers! The sound is so clear! I put this with a Sony amp. System is awesome! wiring woes Haven't hooked it up yet. I need wiring that is longer then 20'....not very easy to do because your committed to BOSE wiring harness.

Great mouse This is my second Logitech mouse. I had the Proteus spectrum previously, and loved it, but wanted something wireless. Although the top button only seems to work half the time, it's a small price to pay for such a nice looking, great working mouse. I would definitely suggest this mouse if you're in the market for a wireless mouse. The battery does last longer than I can play, which is a huuuuuge plus. Great control Smooth movement, and Im glad there arent a million buttons. The charger doesnt get in the way when i use it while its plugged in either.

30," Pontoon Radio Easy to install. Works great in our pontoon... Looks good and installs easily Easy to install and sounds great in my boat! The only thing I have some difficulty with is the Bluetooth. It will connect, but it seems you have to manually do it every time, unlike my vehicle that automatically connects when I get in it. Maybe I am just missing something that allows that to happen. If anyone knows how to solve this issue please let me know. Bluetooth Bluetooth will not sync unless I hook up my USB cord first Great Sound! This system has more bells and whistles than we even need. The sound is great. We replaced another system that came in our boat, and it only lasted a few years. Hoping to get more years out of this one. Worst Product did not work right out of the box. Unfortunately I installed it outside of the return window so it was a total loss. No go on a motorcycle I have this head unit mounted in a motorcycle fairing. Unfortunately, I also have experienced the issue with it randomly changing volume, depending on the vibration level (music and/or engine) of the fairing at any particular moment. Other than that, it's an excellent receiver with a tuner that locks in distant FM stations where others have failed (Kenwood KMRM312BT). I'll be trying the JVC KD-X33MBS this time around. Hopefully, the third time is the charm. I'm getting awfully tired of buying new stereos every six months.... Great Stereo!! Mounted this in my overhead T Top box, make sure you install a quality antenna, stong sound, easy mounting, and so far no issues!! It does not get good reception like the Kenwood I had This stereo is actually water proof.

31," Awesome This is a great loud speaker. Bluetooth capability w the lights gets my kids home party started. Love the quality. Great sound Nice look and great sound with light effects Long life Fantastic! I purchased the lower model at first and upgraded for the better sound + love the ability to pair them. Great sound Great sound, love the lights! Perfect size to take anywhere Good water speaker I needed something to have outside by the pool and in the heat so I decided to do this one because it was on sale. So far so good I barely have to turn it up for it to be loud and works through all the splashes. Wish it had skip and rewind buttons on the actual unit but my phone is never too far. Great sound Love Sony brand divices and the sound of it it is the best Totally what I was looking for. Had to slightly charge before using, but it works great. I can change it, my phone and stream music from my phone at the same time Great sound Great portable speaker. Not only the sound but the appearance itself Great Sound Even at loud volumes it sounds very clear. It is also a perfect size, not too small nor too big for a portable speaker. Killer sound and back for the buck. Not just big bass but great sound and an impressive presence. Battery really does last 20+ hours. It's taken a few splashes and still jams. Great Speakers These speakers are great but I bought them for work and they won't connect to my work laptop unless I have the chord connected. EXTRA Bass with the touch of a button The Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speaker provides amazing lighting to go with any sort of music that you're playing, provides a small and portable design, making it super easy to be taken anywhere (even near water, a little water won't hurt this speaker), and the battery power to keep the music going all night (or day) long. The sound is amazing and if you need an extra kick up in Bass, all you have to do is hit the EXTRA Bass button on the far left of the speaker. Simple, easy, and doesn't distract you from doing whatever you're already doing.Connecting to the speaker is easy, you can either connect via Bluetooth or if you prefer, make sure you have NFC (Near Field Communication) turned on for your device and just bring the device and speaker close to one another and bam, you're connected and ready to play music or whatever audio you want to play. The speaker can be connected to smartphones, tablets, computers, and pretty much everything else with Bluetooth connectivity. You can even connect up to 10 other Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speakers together, creating a Party Chain of Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speakers. Or make it simple and connect another Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speaker for wider stereo sound. Or if you want to skip (or don't have Bluetooth or NFC) connecting wirelessly, you can always connect a 3.5mm cable into the AUX port in the back of the speaker.To further customize your Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speaker, you can install the Sony companion app that can be installed on your device so you can control more features and settings on the speaker. You can turn off or change the mood lighting used by the speaker, you can change the timer for when the speaker turns off on its own after being inactive for a certain period of time, and you can even turn the speaker off with the companion app if you're not near the speaker. Great sound and long battery life This is an amazing water-resistant speaker. The sound is really deep, and there is an Extra Bass button that provides, well, extra bass.The battery can last up to 24 hours, which is more than double for other bluetooth speakers I have. There is also a usb port on the device that can charge other devices.The lights are OK, but there are strobe effects that are annoying (that can be turned off in the Sony app). Or, you can just turn off the lights using the button on the top.Compared to others, this is my go to speaker for using outdoors. The long battery life and the sound quality are really impressive. Sony wireless speaker This Sony wireless speaker is one of the best that I've heard and all my friends are amazed at the sound that they put out the flashing lights are ok to Excellent Bluetooth Speaker, Horrible App Support As far as bluetooth speakers go, this one has amazing sound clarity, volume, and battery life. It charges quickly and pairs well and fast, staying connected with a minimum of issues. The extra bass mode is fantastic and certainly carries the oomph of a much larger speaker.My only complaint is that this speaker is best for party mode. It features an LED ring around the primary facing and two strobes. These lights seemly cannot be turned off (there is no physical button to do so) except through an app you must run on your smartphone. The SongPal app is rated 2 stars on the App Store at the moment, and once you open it, it's clear why. The app can't connect to the speaker, a setup protocol is required, and it doesn't seem to recognize that you're already connected to the speaker in Bluetooth mode. It's not clear if you can shut off the ""party mode"" lights or not as I was never able to get it to connect after several attempts.I haven't tried splashing the speaker with water, although it's clear from the housing near the charging port that the product is water resistant. Sturdy and built well, but not prohibitively heavy - it's the right size to join you at the pool or at the office (provided your coworkers like to party if you can't get the SongPal app to work).Ultimately, this is a really, really nice bluetooth speaker - and if you just leave it as-is, it's pretty darn cool. But if you had to put it in a business setting where LED lighting effects and strobes aren't going to fly, you might want to test out the SongPal app in store before you go much further. clean clear sound Already own a Sony blue tooth speaker so that's why I thought it would be the perfect gift as a housewarming gift for a friend who has a pool and needed some sound on their patio Quality wireless speaker Sound Quality is goodeasy set updoes what its supposed to do Love it it's the best Bluetooth speaker I've purch I give it a 10 plus ad would recommend it to anyone who is looking for one Small size BUT POWERHOUSE SOUND The music coming out of this speaker makes you feel like you are in a club. The lights flash and the bass is so awesome! Can't get enough of this speaker! Went out and bought a second one and started a party chain! Great sound!! I received the information from the sales person. Everything he stated about it is true. I just love my speaker and would tell my friends and family about it. LOVE THEM I love them so much! The colors, the amazing sound, &&the battery life! This speaker is a must!!! Amazing Such good bass and sound quality for such a small speaker and it's totally worth the price. Best Sound for the Money This portable speaker is loud, charges quickly and lasts a long time on a single charge. Good bluetooth speaker I bought this for my daughter and she likes it a lot. No complaints. Great Sony Bluetooth speaker Wow! This new Bluetooth speaker from Sony sounds great! It has a USB for charging and visual lights that really brighten up your party!!! Excelente This speaker is amazing! The sound quality is incredible, and the price is even better. Excellent This is my second Sony Bluetooth speaker. This one was purchased as a gift. My niece used and loved mine so much, I bought her one for her college dorm. These are sturdy and produce good sound. Impromptu purchase Was in Florida on vacation and needed some tunes for the pool. Went to the local Best Buy and test listened to a few floor models. This,one struck me as having the richest sound for the money. Purchased it and couldn't be happier. Connected to my phone very easily. Extra bass feature is nice for my tastes. Great Value for the Money This speaker has great sound and works well to listen to just about anything. Music, movie, audios. It is great! Oh my gosh Disclaimer: I received this product for free from Best Buy and Sony in exchange for my honest review.Oh my gosh, dear Bluetooth speaker, where have you been all my life? I've always just settled for streaming music through my Apple TV/Insignia TV, my laptop, or my phone...but this little thing is a game changer. The sound is great, the extra bass is great, and the lights are a fun little bonus! The setup took less than a minute - you literally only have to turn it on, and then go to the Bluetooth screen on your phone or device and sync them. That's it. You can control the sound and the song selection from your phone using the volume controls and music app. Sony has a couple of iOS apps you can use, but I didn't bother downloading them, because I will likely just use it to play music in my apartment. Also, the color of the speaker is NOT bright blue like the pictures show, it is basically black (I actually had to look at the paperwork again because I thought I was sent the wrong product. I think I actually prefer the dark blue to the bright blue anyway. Older model is better I compared the xb3 and xb30 side by side and thought the xb3 sounded a little better. The light show on the xb30 is dumb. Only improvement is a ""skip track"" button, but I still pick the xb3 over the xb30 Good, but, not great... I recieved this XB30, in exchange for my honest review...Not impressed with the sound from this bluetooth speaker. It has a Bassy & Dull sound to it! For 150.00, it Lacks Highs badly... For example, I have a 40.00 Phillips bluetooth speaker ( SBT300), that plays Clearer than this Sony. Also, the 40.00 Phillips, is 3x larger than this SRS-XB30 Sony! While the Sony has decent Bass, it truely lacks High frequencies. Highs, come across muddy.If you like Bass, and leds, this bluetooth speaker module is for you. If you like clear high frequencies, as I do. I reccommend skipping this, Id rather have better performing Speakers, vs the flashing and color changing leds!I do like that rhis has a rechargable battery, built in. You can also plug your phone or mp3 player directly into this for audio, via 3.5mm adapter. As well as charging, via supplied usb rear input. LOVE THIS SPEAKER! Me and my husband were comparing this speaker and the UE boom/ megaboom. We ultimately went with this speaker and I'm so glad we did! It sounds amazing! You have he option of lights on or off, in the app you can change your sound settings (more bass,treble, etc) the battery life on this speaker is also just a amazing! All in all, I'm so glad we got this speaker! sounds great with the bass boost bought 2 of them, one for my son took hook to hs phone and 1 for my work computer, love them Quality Sound This little guy packs a punch! The extra bass boost creates a solid sound and the battery life lasts a long time; I've had it for around six weeks, used it on 5-6 occasions for several hours at a time without another charge. Also, it hooks Tony iPhone via Bluetooth without the addition of their ""mandatory"" app, which I did try but was a pain to use. Great product! Great speaker This speaker has great sound for the price. Enjoy listening to my favorite music with such great sound. Speaker is Nice The speaker is solid and feels very nice and is portable. It is a little heavier than I would like. I wanted this so I could use it by the pool during the summer and not worry about it falling over or getting wet. The set up was extremely easy and the buttons were easy to press and responsive. I love the lighting that blinks to the beat. The main reason for not giving this 5 stars is the sound. It does not sound as dynamic, the sound just come straight at you, it does not surround you. When you press the extra bass button it is ok. I was hoping this would sound amazing because I have their wireless TV speaker system and headphones, but was disappointed. I love Sony products so I will not give up on this speaker. At this price point I would consider it. Great great great It sounds great and it makes listening to music a lot easier! Great speaker! This speaker has great sound quality and the charge lasts a long time. I have really enjoyed using it. Good Value at this Price Point This is the third Bluetooth speaker we have in the house which enables me to make a direct comparison to two competitors from different manufacturers. However the other two have price points higher than this Sony XB30 with a $149.99 MSRP (one is $50 higher and the other is $100 higher).The Sony comes in multiple colors and the outside of the case has a rubberized finish with metal grilles front and rear (the back one is for a passive radiator). The unit has a nice substantial feel to it and that combined with the feel of the controls gives the sensation of a quality made piece. The front grille is surrounded by a “light bar” that has a number of different preprogrammed colors and patterns along with a couple of white strobes, none of which appear to keep time or rhythm to the music being played. The “light show” variations cannot be accessed directly from the speaker’s built-in controls, you have to make changes from the SongPal app (which is free), but you can toggle the current light selection on or off using a button on the speaker. The jacks for power, audio in, and USB connection (to charge your phone from the speaker) are on the back of the speaker under a cover that has a water resistant gasket as the speaker is IPX5 rated for water resistance. Note that if the cover is open for a connection its water resistance is compromised.The Extra Bass function provides a nice bass boost that once you become accustomed to it, leaves the speaker sounding kind of “tinny” or “thin” when it is turned off. I did find the speaker to be lacking in treble both when playing files from iTunes via my iPhone 6 and when connected with a cable to an iPod Classic playing Apple Lossless files. The SongPal app has a rudimentary three-band graphic equalizer enabling you to adjust bass, midrange and treble from flat to +10 or -10 with three sliders. The bass and mid had a noticeable effect on the content I listened to, but the treble control had virtually no effect that I could tell.Two features I was not able to try out were the “Wireless Party Chain” since I have only one Sony speaker and the LDAC audio technology which is a higher quality Bluetooth connection which appears to be a proprietary Sony technology available on their ZX2 High-Resolution Audio Walkman and Xperia smartphones.I realize I am probably not in the target audience for this particular product due to my age, but I am a little confused by the combination of the “multicolored line light and flashing strobe” that would have probably appealed to the 12-year-old me along with the LDAC technology that comes in a $1200 hi-res music player that the 60-year-old me could afford but has difficulty rationalizing. I would expect someone with a high-resolution, audiophile-quality music player to be shopping wireless speakers at a much higher price point than this.The XB30 has a built-in microphone which enables you to have phone conversations using the device as a speaker/mic. Sound quality was far superior to the iPhone’s speaker phone function for both ends of the conversation (to be expected given the size difference of the speakers between the two devices). This feature helps the XB30 earn a place on your work desk.I think the XB-30 represents a good value for its price point given the additional technology and features it possesses when compared to the two other Bluetooth speakers I am familiar with, however the lack of treble response is a little disappointing, at least to me. Sound quality can be a rather subjective matter, and to be fair I was not able to judge its sound with it being driven by a LDAC capable device. There are many other players at this price level, so I suggest comparing at a retailer where you can listen to multiple speaker choices before making a decision. Sony bluetoothspeaker Wow! What a great sound comes out of this speaker! Whether we use it in the house to listen to our favorite tunes or out by the pool, this speaker has great sound qualify! Great speaker Love this speaker. Take it everywhere even the beach. Good sound It's a nice little unit, portable easy to use and quality of sound is good Amazing sound Wanted a great Bluetooth speaker at a low price and that's what I got Great Item The sound is incredible, i love the fact that you can add more speakers if you wish to, it also is water proof, and the dancing lights are a big plus Sounds Great Bought this for my daughter, it is her first blue tooth speaker but I have had several. Sound is great, she loves the design and the light (she's 17) not so much for me. Very happy! Not bad for the price This unit isn't bad for the price. We only use it when we are outside cooking out. Perfect For $119 you get big bass big sound and big battery with lights to top it off 10/10 Excellent choice you can't go wrong with Sony Gave this to my son as a birthday gift, he is very particular and intentional when it comes to purchasing and owning quality merchandise of any kind. He loves it!! Great bass sound Can get real loud. lights are great for parties. Would be better if chargeable battery works great I love the way it sounds and the extra bass button, however i wish you could turn off the lights. If the lights would blink in Rhythm with the songs, that would be awesome. My son takes it everywhere! My son wanted a speaker to par with his phone for his 8th grade graduation. I must say the sound is great, I love the bass and the addition of the lights changing color and going off and one to the music,unbelievable !! BEST THING I ever purchased for him!!! Thanks SONY. (thinking of buying one for me!) Good Speaker for Indoor Great lights which are always on when using and good for indoors ...Might not give good volume outdoors... Love my speaker This was a father's day gift for my husband. He loves it, battery lasts a long time and sound is amazing Good product Overall, this is a nice product with good battery life. The only reason I did give it five stars is you have to adjust the equalizer depending on the volume you're listening your music at. Very good sound quality Very good quality product. Perfect size, color and light effects as music plays is great. Best speaker This is best speaker to listen in room plus you make it surround sound Amazing To be honest you guys always sell the best product and I can't say anything about what you guys sale I'm amazed Great Sound! Great sound and good bass. Stays charged for a long time. Definitely a good value. Sony Bluetooth speaker Great battery life and sound. Easy to carry and take with you anywhere Great sound, but wont stayed liked to my iphone This speaker has great sound and is powerful. on the downside I sometimes have to relink it to my Bluetooth. Great speakers Great sound. Love the changing of colors. My son loves it Good batery Is a good ten good sound and small size I can take everywhere I LOVED At first I must accept that I did not have many expectations of my purchase with Sony, but turned out to be much more and overcome all my ideas of it. I like the color and form so easy it connects to Bluetooth devices. The size is perfect and I can take it wherever I want. I can rate it as Excellent buy! great speaker for the size My fianc bought this to take along with him, and it works great, good battery life and overall sound is excellent. Awesome Bluetooth Speaker This speaker is the absolute best sounding speaker for it's size, great bass response and sound quality overall.Would definitely buy more of them, have two now and want two more! Worth the money I got my speaker to listen to music when entertaining company and cooking outside. This speaker packs a lot of volume and the optional bass feature is nice too! Small compact The Sony speaker is about as good as it get at this size and price point. Awesome This is a great loud speaker. Bluetooth capability w the lights gets my kids home party started. Love the quality. Great sound Nice look and great sound with light effects Long life Fantastic! I purchased the lower model at first and upgraded for the better sound + love the ability to pair them. Great sound Great sound, love the lights! Perfect size to take anywhere Good water speaker I needed something to have outside by the pool and in the heat so I decided to do this one because it was on sale. So far so good I barely have to turn it up for it to be loud and works through all the splashes. Wish it had skip and rewind buttons on the actual unit but my phone is never too far. Great sound Love Sony brand divices and the sound of it it is the best Totally what I was looking for. Had to slightly charge before using, but it works great. I can change it, my phone and stream music from my phone at the same time Great sound Great portable speaker. Not only the sound but the appearance itself Great Sound Even at loud volumes it sounds very clear. It is also a perfect size, not too small nor too big for a portable speaker. Killer sound and back for the buck. Not just big bass but great sound and an impressive presence. Battery really does last 20+ hours. It's taken a few splashes and still jams. Great Speakers These speakers are great but I bought them for work and they won't connect to my work laptop unless I have the chord connected. EXTRA Bass with the touch of a button The Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speaker provides amazing lighting to go with any sort of music that you're playing, provides a small and portable design, making it super easy to be taken anywhere (even near water, a little water won't hurt this speaker), and the battery power to keep the music going all night (or day) long. The sound is amazing and if you need an extra kick up in Bass, all you have to do is hit the EXTRA Bass button on the far left of the speaker. Simple, easy, and doesn't distract you from doing whatever you're already doing.Connecting to the speaker is easy, you can either connect via Bluetooth or if you prefer, make sure you have NFC (Near Field Communication) turned on for your device and just bring the device and speaker close to one another and bam, you're connected and ready to play music or whatever audio you want to play. The speaker can be connected to smartphones, tablets, computers, and pretty much everything else with Bluetooth connectivity. You can even connect up to 10 other Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speakers together, creating a Party Chain of Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speakers. Or make it simple and connect another Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speaker for wider stereo sound. Or if you want to skip (or don't have Bluetooth or NFC) connecting wirelessly, you can always connect a 3.5mm cable into the AUX port in the back of the speaker.To27," Great Price I just needed a basic system for my man cave room in the basement. This is a very good system for the price. Great value for quality speakers After owning two sets of Logitec surround sound 5.1 speakers for my computer, and having both of them stop working after barely over a year of use, I decided to go with Yamaha, a brand with a long established reputation for building good quality speakers and audio products. The speakers sound noticeably better than my last set, have really good specs for frequency response and distortion levels, comes with a huge subwoofer, and can handle enough watts to meet my expectations for the need to listen music at least as loud as concert volume. I have not watched movies using surround sound yet, but I paired the speakers with a new Sony amp STR=DH540 (also $129) and plugged in a new Chromecast, and now once again I can play music from my computer, only this time it sounds even better and I'm expecting it to last and use it for home theater as well. Great sound for a low price Sound is a huge improvement over my ten year old Sony speakers. Great for anyone looking for above average sound quality for a price that won't break the bank. Totally like it for its solid quality After we test it in our newly remodeled basement, we find we totally like it. The quality of the sound is amazing and the low price makes it even sweeter. Great Speakers! Great speakers and sound....also easy to hook up.... All positive!!!!! Go get you some Best Buy !!!! They have Great service!! Super knowledgeable people. The prices are right on!!! Great Price, Great Sound Replaced an old Sony 5.1 set and for the price these speakers are great. Solid construction and great sound! Compact system for small home office I enjoy the sound quality that this system has. I've purchased other Yamaha speakers and the durability and sound quality seems to be matching those from 12+ years ago. I would purchase these again if needed a small system. As always...a ""Best"" Buy! A great surround speaker system at a very affordable price. Not necessarily what you would set up in a banquet hall, but more than adequate for home use. Very well made, nice size, and the sound is awesome. Recommend this system to anyone looking to add satellites or upgrading their older system. Better than more expensive systems. 149 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No It took me weeks of research before I purchased this product. I liked the idea of the Yamaha name, but was concerned the quality would be less than optimal because the price was so low. While I am not an audiophile I like to have the best my limited money can buy. The 6 Ohm rating was a big hiccup for me as well, as 8 ohm is what all receiver ratings are calculated on. But after looking closely at the manual for my receiver I found it supported 6-16 Ohm speakers. So we were good there. My receiver, a Pioneer VSK-519 showed up before my speakers so I hooked it up to some Sony book shelf speakers to test it out. When the Yamaha speakers came I was only able to hook up three of the five speakers with the included speaker wire, so I used the Sony's as R and L. The Sony's put out noticeably more sound than the Yamaha's which was at first concerning to me. And once I got them out of the way I had to turn the receiver up higher to get the same output. I watch movies right around 50-52 when with the Sony speakers, I was quite happy at 40. I suspect this is related to the 82 db rating (and the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5).

Was this review helpful to you Yes No VERY easy to hook up, sounds great and for a good price. And more than enough wire to install all speakers. Just need the right receiver for it thats all. good speakers, cheap price These speakers are a great value at around 100 dollars. They work great and sound amazing for small speakers. The sub is has its own volume control and I have yet to turn it past a quarter of the way up because the thumping, clear base shakes the house fairly well. The only issues with this system are minor. First the speaker wire is only about a 24 gauge, which for small rooms is perfectly fine. On a positive note there is 100ft of this wire included. The only other minor problem is they are 6 ohm speakers. Most receivers will have an option for running this so it's a fairly simple fix. So this is a perfect set for people on a budget but in want of great surround sound for a small to medium sized room. These would even work well in a large room as long as you aren't trying to blast the speaker volume loud enough to wake the neighbors.

28," Crisp, clean sound I bought this to replace my old Sony system. I also bought a Sony STRD H550 receiver to go with it. The speaker system is very easy to set up. You have to purchase wall mounting brackets separately for the surround speakers. Use Caution!!! First I had to wait to have this product shipped to the store near me since that store did not carry them. When I finally got the speakers, they did not work! This item does not include some kind of receiver or remote and if you want to mount the speakers to the wall or hook them up to some stands then you are going to have to purchase special adapters for each speaker that costs about $35-45 for ea speaker! Horrible experience so I returned this product and got some Klipsch speakers instead and now I'm happy! Is anything better than Bose?? Love, love, love these speakers! The sound is so clear! I put this with a Sony amp. System is awesome! wiring woes Haven't hooked it up yet. I need wiring that is longer then 20'....not very easy to do because your committed to BOSE wiring harness. Its not your typical home theater wire up....right now I only give it 3 stars because of where I'm at with this right now.... Crisp, clean sound I bought this to replace my old Sony system.

Great control Smooth movement, and Im glad there arent a million buttons. The charger doesnt get in the way when i use it while its plugged in either. Great mouse The design if the mouse makes so easy to use. Grandson loves it. Great mouse This is my daily driver and it is the best mouse I have ever owned. Best one so far very good batery last alot and materials are grate. i use to play shotting games Great Mouse I'm not a hardcore gamer so I can't comment on how it is for that. What I can say is that is really comfortable to use, the buttons have satisfying click to it and it looks slick and minimal even with the RGB lights. Battery life is not great but that's because of the high quality sensor it has. Awesome mouse Awesome gaming mouse, rechargeable and very versatile, im going to buy a second one."
30," Pontoon Radio Easy to install. Works great in our pontoon... Looks good and installs easily Easy to install and sounds great in my boat! The only thing I have some difficulty with is the Bluetooth. It will connect, but it seems you have to manually do it every time, unlike my vehicle that automatically connects when I get in it. Maybe I am just missing something that allows that to happen. If anyone knows how to solve this issue please let me know. Bluetooth Bluetooth will not sync unless I hook up my USB cord first Great Sound! This system has more bells and whistles than we even need. The sound is great. We replaced another system that came in our boat, and it only lasted a few years. Hoping to get more years out of this one. Worst Product did not work right out of the box. Unfortunately I installed it outside of the return window so it was a total loss. No go on a motorcycle I have this head unit mounted in a motorcycle fairing. Unfortunately, I also have experienced the issue with it randomly changing volume, depending on the vibration level (music and/or engine) of the fairing at any particular moment. Other than that, it's an excellent receiver with a tuner that locks in distant FM stations where others have failed (Kenwood KMRM312BT). I'll be trying the JVC KD-X33MBS this time around. Hopefully, the third time is the charm. I'm getting awfully tired of buying new stereos every six months.... Great Stereo!! Mounted this in my overhead T Top box, make sure you install a quality antenna, stong sound, easy mounting, and so far no issues!! It does not get good reception like the Kenwood I had This stereo is actually water proof. It does not get good reception like the Kenwood I had, but the Kenwood was not even close to water proof.Expect poor reception on the water if you buy this stereo. Great sound Bought for my husband's birthday for his boat. He loves the radio so far. Works well. Works well! Only issue is the remote signal doesn't reach very far at all, maybe 2-3 ft max.

31," Awesome This is a great loud speaker. Bluetooth capability w the lights gets my kids home party started. Love the quality. Great sound Nice look and great sound with light effects Long life Fantastic! I purchased the lower model at first and upgraded for the better sound + love the ability to pair them. Great sound Great sound, love the lights! Perfect size to take anywhere Good water speaker I needed something to have outside by the pool and in the heat so I decided to do this one because it was on sale. So far so good I barely have to turn it up for it to be loud and works through all the splashes. Wish it had skip and rewind buttons on the actual unit but my phone is never too far. Great sound Love Sony brand divices and the sound of it it is the best Totally what I was looking for. Had to slightly charge before using, but it works great. I can change it, my phone and stream music from my phone at the same time Great sound Great portable speaker. Not only the sound but the appearance itself Great Sound Even at loud volumes it sounds very clear. It is also a perfect size, not too small nor too big for a portable speaker. Killer sound and back for the buck. Not just big bass but great sound and an impressive presence. Battery really does last 20+ hours. It's taken a few splashes and still jams. Great Speakers These speakers are great but I bought them for work and they won't connect to my work laptop unless I have the chord connected. EXTRA Bass with the touch of a button The Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speaker provides amazing lighting to go with any sort of music that you're playing, provides a small and portable design, making it super easy to be taken anywhere (even near water, a little water won't hurt this speaker), and the battery power to keep the music going all night (or day) long. The sound is amazing and if you need an extra kick up in Bass, all you have to do is hit the EXTRA Bass button on the far left of the speaker. Simple, easy, and doesn't distract you from doing whatever you're already doing.Connecting to the speaker is easy, you can either connect via Bluetooth or if you prefer, make sure you have NFC (Near Field Communication) turned on for your device and just bring the device and speaker close to one another and bam, you're connected and ready to play music or whatever audio you want to play. The speaker can be connected to smartphones, tablets, computers, and pretty much everything else with Bluetooth connectivity. You can even connect up to 10 other Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speakers together, creating a Party Chain of Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speakers. Or make it simple and connect another Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speaker for wider stereo sound. Or if you want to skip (or don't have Bluetooth or NFC) connecting wirelessly, you can always connect a 3.5mm cable into the AUX port in the back of the speaker.To further customize your Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speaker, you can install the Sony companion app that can be installed on your device so you can control more features and settings on the speaker. You can turn off or change the mood lighting used by the speaker, you can change the timer for when the speaker turns off on its own after being inactive for a certain period of time, and you can even turn the speaker off with the companion app if you're not near the speaker. Great sound and long battery life This is an amazing water-resistant speaker. The sound is really deep, and there is an Extra Bass button that provides, well, extra bass.The battery can last up to 24 hours, which is more than double for other bluetooth speakers I have. There is also a usb port on the device that can charge other devices.The lights are OK, but there are strobe effects that are annoying (that can be turned off in the Sony app). Or, you can just turn off the lights using the button on the top.Compared to others, this is my go to speaker for using outdoors. The long battery life and the sound quality are really impressive. Sony wireless speaker This Sony wireless speaker is one of the best that I've heard and all my friends are amazed at the sound that they put out the flashing lights are ok to Excellent Bluetooth Speaker, Horrible App Support As far as bluetooth speakers go, this one has amazing sound clarity, volume, and battery life. It charges quickly and pairs well and fast, staying connected with a minimum of issues. The extra bass mode is fantastic and certainly carries the oomph of a much larger speaker.My only complaint is that this speaker is best for party mode. It features an LED ring around the primary facing and two strobes. These lights seemly cannot be turned off (there is no physical button to do so) except through an app you must run on your smartphone. The SongPal app is rated 2 stars on the App Store at the moment, and once you open it, it's clear why. The app can't connect to the speaker, a setup protocol is required, and it doesn't seem to recognize that you're already connected to the speaker in Bluetooth mode. It's not clear if you can shut off the ""party mode"" lights or not as I was never able to get it to connect after several attempts.I haven't tried splashing the speaker with water, although it's clear from the housing near the charging port that the product is water resistant. Sturdy and built well, but not prohibitively heavy - it's the right size to join you at the pool or at the office (provided your coworkers like to party if you can't get the SongPal app to work).Ultimately, this is a really, really nice bluetooth speaker - and if you just leave it as-is, it's pretty darn cool. But if you had to put it in a business setting where LED lighting effects and strobes aren't going to fly, you might want to test out the SongPal app in store before you go much further. clean clear sound Already own a Sony blue tooth speaker so that's why I thought it would be the perfect gift as a housewarming gift for a friend who has a pool and needed some sound on their patio Quality wireless speaker Sound Quality is goodeasy set updoes what its supposed to do Love it it's the best Bluetooth speaker I've purch I give it a 10 plus ad would recommend it to anyone who is looking for one Small size BUT POWERHOUSE SOUND The music coming out of this speaker makes you feel like you are in a club. The lights flash and the bass is so awesome! Can't get enough of this speaker! Went out and bought a second one and started a party chain! Great sound!! I received the information from the sales person. Everything he stated about it is true. I just love my speaker and would tell my friends and family about it. LOVE THEM I love them so much! The colors, the amazing sound, &&the battery life! This speaker is a must!!! Amazing Such good bass and sound quality for such a small speaker and it's totally worth the price. Best Sound for the Money This portable speaker is loud, charges quickly and lasts a long time on a single charge. Good bluetooth speaker I bought this for my daughter and she likes it a lot. No complaints. Great Sony Bluetooth speaker Wow! This new Bluetooth speaker from Sony sounds great! It has a USB for charging and visual lights that really brighten up your party!!! Excelente This speaker is amazing! The sound quality is incredible, and the price is even better. Excellent This is my second Sony Bluetooth speaker. This one was purchased as a gift. My niece used and loved mine so much, I bought her one for her college dorm. These are sturdy and produce good sound. Impromptu purchase Was in Florida on vacation and needed some tunes for the pool. Went to the local Best Buy and test listened to a few floor models. This,one struck me as having the richest sound for the money. Purchased it and couldn't be happier. Connected to my phone very easily. Extra bass feature is nice for my tastes. Great Value for the Money This speaker has great sound and works well to listen to just about anything. Music, movie, audios. It is great! Oh my gosh Disclaimer: I received this product for free from Best Buy and Sony in exchange for my honest review.Oh my gosh, dear Bluetooth speaker, where have you been all my life? I've always just settled for streaming music through my Apple TV/Insignia TV, my laptop, or my phone...but this little thing is a game changer. The sound is great, the extra bass is great, and the lights are a fun little bonus! The setup took less than a minute - you literally only have to turn it on, and then go to the Bluetooth screen on your phone or device and sync them. That's it. You can control the sound and the song selection from your phone using the volume controls and music app. Sony has a couple of iOS apps you can use, but I didn't bother downloading them, because I will likely just use it to play music in my apartment. Also, the color of the speaker is NOT bright blue like the pictures show, it is basically black (I actually had to look at the paperwork again because I thought I was sent the wrong product. I think I actually prefer the dark blue to the bright blue anyway. Older model is better I compared the xb3 and xb30 side by side and thought the xb3 sounded a little better. The light show on the xb30 is dumb. Only improvement is a ""skip track"" button, but I still pick the xb3 over the xb30 Good, but, not great... I recieved this XB30, in exchange for my honest review...Not impressed with the sound from this bluetooth speaker. It has a Bassy & Dull sound to it! For 150.00, it Lacks Highs badly... For example, I have a 40.00 Phillips bluetooth speaker ( SBT300), that plays Clearer than this Sony. Also, the 40.00 Phillips, is 3x larger than this SRS-XB30 Sony! While the Sony has decent Bass, it truely lacks High frequencies. Highs, come across muddy.If you like Bass, and leds, this bluetooth speaker module is for you. If you like clear high frequencies, as I do. I reccommend skipping this, Id rather have better performing Speakers, vs the flashing and color changing leds!I do like that rhis has a rechargable battery, built in. You can also plug your phone or mp3 player directly into this for audio, via 3.5mm adapter. As well as charging, via supplied usb rear input. LOVE THIS SPEAKER! Me and my husband were comparing this speaker and the UE boom/ megaboom. We ultimately went with this speaker and I'm so glad we did! It sounds amazing! You have he option of lights on or off, in the app you can change your sound settings (more bass,treble, etc) the battery life on this speaker is also just a amazing! All in all, I'm so glad we got this speaker! sounds great with the bass boost bought 2 of them, one for my son took hook to hs phone and 1 for my work computer, love them Quality Sound This little guy packs a punch! The extra bass boost creates a solid sound and the battery life lasts a long time; I've had it for around six weeks, used it on 5-6 occasions for several hours at a time without another charge. Also, it hooks Tony iPhone via Bluetooth without the addition of their ""mandatory"" app, which I did try but was a pain to use. Great product! Great speaker This speaker has great sound for the price. Enjoy listening to my favorite music with such great sound. Speaker is Nice The speaker is solid and feels very nice and is portable. It is a little heavier than I would like. I wanted this so I could use it by the pool during the summer and not worry about it falling over or getting wet. The set up was extremely easy and the buttons were easy to press and responsive. I love the lighting that blinks to the beat. The main reason for not giving this 5 stars is the sound. It does not sound as dynamic, the sound just come straight at you, it does not surround you. When you press the extra bass button it is ok. I was hoping this would sound amazing because I have their wireless TV speaker system and headphones, but was disappointed. I love Sony products so I will not give up on this speaker. At this price point I would consider it. Great great great It sounds great and it makes listening to music a lot easier! Great speaker! This speaker has great sound quality and the charge lasts a long time. I have really enjoyed using it. Good Value at this Price Point This is the third Bluetooth speaker we have in the house which enables me to make a direct comparison to two competitors from different manufacturers. However the other two have price points higher than this Sony XB30 with a $149.99 MSRP (one is $50 higher and the other is $100 higher).The Sony comes in multiple colors and the outside of the case has a rubberized finish with metal grilles front and rear (the back one is for a passive radiator). The unit has a nice substantial feel to it and that combined with the feel of the controls gives the sensation of a quality made piece. The front grille is surrounded by a “light bar” that has a number of different preprogrammed colors and patterns along with a couple of white strobes, none of which appear to keep time or rhythm to the music being played. The “light show” variations cannot be accessed directly from the speaker’s built-in controls, you have to make changes from the SongPal app (which is free), but you can toggle the current light selection on or off using a button on the speaker. The jacks for power, audio in, and USB connection (to charge your phone from the speaker) are on the back of the speaker under a cover that has a water resistant gasket as the speaker is IPX5 rated for water resistance. Note that if the cover is open for a connection its water resistance is compromised.The Extra Bass function provides a nice bass boost that once you become accustomed to it, leaves the speaker sounding kind of “tinny” or “thin” when it is turned off. I did find the speaker to be lacking in treble both when playing files from iTunes via my iPhone 6 and when connected with a cable to an iPod Classic playing Apple Lossless files. The SongPal app has a rudimentary three-band graphic equalizer enabling you to adjust bass, midrange and treble from flat to +10 or -10 with three sliders. The bass and mid had a noticeable effect on the content I listened to, but the treble control had virtually no effect that I could tell.Two features I was not able to try out were the “Wireless Party Chain” since I have only one Sony speaker and the LDAC audio technology which is a higher quality Bluetooth connection which appears to be a proprietary Sony technology available on their ZX2 High-Resolution Audio Walkman and Xperia smartphones.I realize I am probably not in the target audience for this particular product due to my age, but I am a little confused by the combination of the “multicolored line light and flashing strobe” that would have probably appealed to the 12-year-old me along with the LDAC technology that comes in a $1200 hi-res music player that the 60-year-old me could afford but has difficulty rationalizing. I would expect someone with a high-resolution, audiophile-quality music player to be shopping wireless speakers at a much higher price point than this.The XB30 has a built-in microphone which enables you to have phone conversations using the device as a speaker/mic. Sound quality was far superior to the iPhone’s speaker phone function for both ends of the conversation (to be expected given the size difference of the speakers between the two devices). This feature helps the XB30 earn a place on your work desk.I think the XB-30 represents a good value for its price point given the additional technology and features it possesses when compared to the two other Bluetooth speakers I am familiar with, however the lack of treble response is a little disappointing, at least to me. Sound quality can be a rather subjective matter, and to be fair I was not able35," Awesome sound They have better sound then my friends Bose speaker.I am happy that I listened to the best buy sales rep who told me that the speakers are made with Kevlar and not paper like the Bose speakers. Great great sound. Awesome Sound! These are great outdoor speakers! The sound is awesome and they are built well. I especially like the strong base sound and solid mounting brackets. awsome The look and wattage is spectacular. They are easy to set up and move around. No problems here. Great sound Bought 2 of this speakers and i am glad i did, i have Definitive Technology speakers in my home theatre room and i love them and I am still impressed with the quality of sound for outdoor speaker's. Price is a little high but still worth it!!!! These are great These are the second set of these speakers. We bought the first paid and they sound great and are loud so we got another set for the other side of the yard. Love it! I have 4 of these outside in the patio area. Very clear and rich tone. The best out door speaker ! I've had different out door speakers but these are by far the best. After I broke them in they sounded even better. Deffentlly go with deff tech! Extremely happy I recieve several compliments from friends and neighbors. The sound is crystal clear and looks s great. Throws plenty of sound around my pool area kids even say they can here when under water. Solid outdoor speaker I used mine in a cover patio. The bass fill the space nicely. Best sounding speakers for the money. Worth the money, amazing Awesome outdoor speakers if you're looking for durability. Price is great also! Just right for the party! After looking for a set of speakers that would not blow the budget, but also not sacrifice the quality of sound, we chose these D.A. outdoor speakers. The installation was easy. We have ~550sqft patio and there is plenty of sound, including bass to be felt. It is hooked up to volume control switch just inside the door running off a Denon DRA-397 which handles five sets of speakers in the house. Great speaker A little pricey, but well worth the performance. Seems to hold up to the outdoor elements very well. Bass and quality sound outdoors is no longer an issue... After buying and returning Bose products, I am happy to report that these are the answer to the outdoor sound dillema. These speaker make music sound great outside on my deck. All genres sound great and clear... Most of the murky highs and crappy lows units did not compare to much more then a boom box while with these deliver at the level of outdoor PA speakers with a 10 - 12 woofer.Don't look much farther if you're in the market for quality outdoor sound. Great outdoor speakers. Installed 4 AW 6500 speakers at our pool pavilion. Great sound - clear details, no subwoofer needed. I love bose products but these were better than bose 251. Satisfied I have been hammering these speakers since I purchased them, they're loud and sound quality is good. Looking to purchase another set in the near future. Awesome speaker! Debated between this and re BOSE environmental speakers. I went to Best Buy and listened to them. So glad I got these. Best quality and worth the extra money.

36," Good Speakers Nice and loud good base I have no complaints with these speakers ! Not Enough Bass I bought these on the recommendation of the store salesman, sounded pretty good in a the store, however they didn't have a lot of bass when I hooked them up. I exchanged them for another brand same price range and they were great! Good product for the price Good quality but could be better!! Overall I'm happy with my purchase!!! These are GREAT speakers! I replaced all four door speakers in ... These are GREAT speakers! I replaced all four door speakers in my 2007 Silverado Crew Cab and it sounds amazing. I added a 10 inch subwoofer for some bass because despite what anyone says, 6-1/2 speakers are NOT for bass. They DO, however, play crystal clear mids and highs without any distortion at nearly full volume (so loud it hurts).I am going to buy some to replace the speakers in my wife's car next. Go ahead and buy some for yourself, you won't be disappointed. Exactly what I wanted! got these speakers on sale and they were definitely worth every penny! Great speakers They sound wonderful. A great price for a well made speaker Good for sale price paid Great replacement for VW Jetta rear door speakers. Alpine SPE-6000 Speakers - Excellent Speakers I am no audiophile but these speakers are incredible for the price. If you are into the idea that high-dollar speakers are better because they cost more then this review is not for you. I have a 2004 Mitsubishi Montereo Sport (without the Infinity system installed) and the passenger side stock speaker was blown. I decided to shop around for not only for middle-priced speakers but also a brand name that was reputatble.Not only did I get more than I bargained for, I liked them so much, I swapped out the entire SUV!I replaced the front speakers first and did a test run ( I listen to Metal music) and the sound was clean and crisp on the highs and the lows were not bad either. Don't get me wrong, you are not going to hear the lowest of the lows with these speakers but the sound quailty of the bass was more than adequate.I could definitely tell the difference between the new SPE-6000's and the stock in the back. For the price and quality, I decided I wanted to change out the rest of the vehicle. Let's say I am very pleased with these speakers and I do recommend them. My car does not have all the amps, crossovers and bells and whistles but for a good price in my opinion, these speakers were way better than expected.-SuperDave71Memphis, TN Great sound and quality! Great product at a great price. Exceptional sound! Great speakers for the price Bestbuy price matched the competition & gave me a great deal. I originally wanted something that wasn't going to break the bank and thats what I got what these. These speakers sound great in my wife's 2004 envoy xuv.

Sounds Great! I purchased these speakers to replace my 6 1/2 inch speakers in my 17 SeaRay bow rider and they sound and work great, easy to install and fit just right. Excellent Alpines for the price Audio is crisp and clean. They sound great in my suburban. Great Product Bought this with another pair of speakers for my daily. Great product. Huge upgrade from my previous speakers. Good Speakers We put these speakers into a Chevrolet Silverado truck. Definitely made a difference. Good sound for the money. Great speakers Great sounding speakers & alpine are quality speakers at a great price really notice sound difference Wrong ohms I did not realize how much volume would be lost going from a 2ohm to 4ohm. Sound Upgrade from Factory Speakers These speakers sound very good for the type of jazz music I like to listen to in the car. I followed the advice of the BBuy installer and replaced my front door speakers. I plan to buy a second pair of Alpines for the rear deck. Alpine Speakers Quality speakers for our vehicle.Excellent sound.. great speakers Great Speakers, Very Good Sound and Better Than The Factory. Just Put it on a Chevy Silverado .

Nice Speakers for the price I caught these on a ""mega sale"". Went ahead and got 4. Love them as an upgrade over factory speakers. Alpine sounds great I recommend Alpine products due to their consistent quality. They fit the car door speaker openings. Great mid range and richness. I need an amp to bring out their best. Five Stars This speaker sounds great! Easy install. Alpine Car Speakers When the Best Buy store I visited didn't have what I wanted in stock, I decided to take a chance on these Alpine speakers. They were a few dollars more, but I'm glad I made this purchase. Easy to install and they sound really good. Crisp highs, mid-range and decent lows. I do not have an amp (just a stock stereo) to really drive these, but I'm sure if you did it would improve the sound quality. Overall I would rate these a 4.5 and would recommend them to anyone who would like to upgrade their stock or modified system. great sound very easy to install, love the sound, price was within reason. Great Speakers for Mid Range Price Sound is great. Great sound. Would recommend this to anyone. Sound great! Nice! I'm picky, and these sounded great in my little MG in a small speaker box behind the seats. Good Speakers Nice and loud good base I have no complaints with these speakers !

Go ahead and buy some for yourself, you won't be disappointed. Exactly what I wanted! got these speakers on sale and they were definitely worth every penny! Great speakers They sound wonderful. A great price for a well made speaker Good for sale price paid Great replacement for VW Jetta rear door speakers. Alpine SPE-6000 Speakers - Excellent Speakers I am no audiophile but these speakers are incredible for the price. If you are into the idea that high-dollar speakers are better because they cost more then this review is not for you. I have a 2004 Mitsubishi Montereo Sport (without the Infinity system installed) and the passenger side stock speaker was blown. I decided to shop around for not only for middle-priced speakers but also a brand name that was reputatble.Not only did I get more than I bargained for, I liked them so much, I swapped out the entire SUV!I replaced the front speakers first and did a test run ( I listen to Metal music) and the sound was clean and crisp on the highs and the lows were not bad either. Don't get me wrong, you are not going to hear the lowest of the lows with these speakers but the sound quailty of the bass was more than adequate.I could definitely tell the difference between the new SPE-6000's and the stock in the back. For the price and quality, I decided I wanted to change out the rest of the vehicle. Let's say I am very pleased with these speakers and I do recommend them. My car does not have all the amps, crossovers and bells and whistles but for a good price in my opinion, these speakers were way better than expected.-SuperDave71Memphis, TN Great sound and quality! Great product at a great price. Exceptional sound! Great speakers for the price Bestbuy price matched the competition & gave me a great deal. I originally wanted something that wasn't going to break the bank and thats what I got what these. These speakers sound great in my wife's 2004 envoy xuv.

Excellent Alpines for the price Audio is crisp and clean. They sound great in my suburban. Great Product Bought this with another pair of speakers for my daily. Great product. Huge upgrade from my previous speakers. Good Speakers We put these speakers into a Chevrolet Silverado truck. Definitely made a difference. Good sound for the money. Great speakers Great sounding speakers & alpine are quality speakers at a great price really notice sound difference Wrong ohms I did not realize how much volume would be lost going from a 2ohm to 4ohm. Sound Upgrade from Factory Speakers These speakers sound very good for the type of jazz music I like to listen to in the car. I followed the advice of the BBuy installer and replaced my front door speakers. I plan to buy a second pair of Alpines for the rear deck. Alpine Speakers Quality speakers for our vehicle.Excellent sound.. great speakers Great Speakers, Very Good Sound and Better Than The Factory. Just Put it on a Chevy Silverado .

Nice Speakers for the price I caught these on a ""mega sale"". Went ahead and got 4. Love them as an upgrade over factory speakers. Alpine sounds great I recommend Alpine products due to their consistent quality. They fit the car door speaker openings. Great mid range and richness. I need an amp to bring out their best. Five Stars This speaker sounds great! Easy install. Alpine Car Speakers When the Best Buy store I visited didn't have what I wanted in stock, I decided to take a chance on these Alpine speakers. They were a few dollars more, but I'm glad I made this purchase. Easy to install and they sound really good. Crisp highs, mid-range and decent lows. I do not have an amp (just a stock stereo) to really drive these, but I'm sure if you did it would improve the sound quality. Overall I would rate these a 4.5 and would recommend them to anyone who would like to upgrade their stock or modified system. great sound very easy to install, love the sound, price was within reason. Great Speakers for Mid Range Price Sound is great. Great sound. Would recommend this to anyone. Sound great! Nice! I'm picky, and these sounded great in my little MG in a small speaker box behind the seats."
37," A little bulky but works great! Had this in Vegas and charged 4 phone off it for most of the day so it was great not to have to find an charge station or head back to the hotel. Versatile Like the fact that that it is a charger, surge protector with multiple other uses and so portable. Would purchase again! Easy yo use compact charger This Belkin Portable charger works well and is easy to use. ITS ALRIGHT... This travel charger has a cheap build quality but considering the price it isn't a big deal. Also the plugins on it DO NOT CHARGE unless the charger is plugged in!!! So really the only thing that this charges is the 1 usb port. Plus I only get half to a full iPhone charge on a full charge of the Belkin Travel Charger. Good Works well , Keeos Phone Charged 100% while using your phone Good backup travel charger The Belkin charger is a great go to when in need of an alternative charging source. Inexpensive but well worth it. A little bulky but works great!

38," Great Sound Takes your music library to new hights!I was looking for Headphones that were a step above the high end massmarket.It was well invested money, and there is no going back, excellent sound and comfortable! CAN'T GO WRONG WITH B&W I ORIGINALLY BROUGHT THE P5s BEING CHEAP. ONCE I HEARD THE CLARITY OF THEM I JUST FELT LIKE I WAS CHEATING MYSELF INSTEAD OF SAVING THE MONEY. I DROVE PAST 2 BESTBUYS THAT DIDN'T HAVE THEM JUST TO GET THEM THE SAME DAY.I RETURNED THE P5s IN VALLEY STREAMS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE P7s. I HAVE LISTENED TO THRILLER FOR 25 YEARS, BUT I HEARD THINGS IN THE BACKGROUND THAT I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE WEARING THE P7s. Great headphones for Audiophiles When I hear sounds that I've never heard before from songs that I've been listening for years, it is a good sign. The best you can buy After shopping around a long time I couldn't find any headset that had all of the main factors I needed in a headset until I found the B & W P7. The build quality is solid. The sound is amazing. The fit over the ears is great and blocks out all ambient noise. The case is not what I would expect but it does the job. The fit over the head is a bit tight so it can be a bit uncomfortable at times. If you try these out, nothing else will satisfy you so don't even try them unless you plan to buy them. Best Headphones Ever Purchased By far the best piece of equipment I have put on my head let alone ears. Relaxing when I was on a plane, to serious and upbeat while at work. So comfortable I forget where the lovely harmonic sound is coming from. I would upgrade from the other big name headphones any day to these. The cord is a bit short for laying in bed purposes otherwise a phenomenal investment. Just Short of Greatness I really liked these and wanted to keep them because they make one heck of a first impression but I ultimately had to return them. Removing the lid of the box greets you with the unmistakable smell of brand new, genuine leather. From the thick headband to the ear cups, this baby is soft, premium leather all the way. The metal frame that connects them is strong and gives confidence that they're not going to accidentally bend or break from anything but an almost intentional force against them. Here's my first comparison to it's peers. Most every other set, even over $300 is almost completely plastic. This is solid metal and leather through and through and it's heavier than its competitors for it. That's already a striking difference and makes a good argument for a higher price tag. It's obviously a higher quality product with better materials. I also like that the ear cups are removable and magnetically attached. Should there be an unrepairable break or tear, just buy a new set and pop them on. Underneath the left cup is where the cord attaches. This is also a great idea as the port tends to get damaged when the cord is pulled or water seeps in. You can tell there was a lot of thought put towards the design. The picture doesn't do these justice. They impress from top to bottom. One thing they don't look like is something you want to sweat all over or wear on rainy days so have something else for gyms, sweltering heat and storm season outdoors. They're also softer than they look. The ear pads are filled with memory foam so they're very soft to the touch and the headband is also nicely padded. I also like the added thickness on top. They did feel good at first when I put them on, but I felt some discomfort during my hours of wearing them. The clamping pressure started to make my upper jaw, under my ear ache. They seal very well and isolate from most of the outside noise. They're easily the best noise isolating headphones I've ever put on. They fold in on both sides to fit easier in a small bag or case, making them more portable. The ear cups don't swivel though.I'll be honest here about the sound. I have to say, I came away disappointed. They don't sound bad by any means but they're warmer in the mid range that I like which sacrifices some of the treble that I'm used to. I cycled through a variety of different types of music and when comparing them directly against my Audio Technica M50X's, they didn't blow them away, which is what I was kind of expecting them to do given their price point and reputation. I then realized that it wasn't a realistic expectation because my M50X's are actually very good headphones and nothing is going to make them sound like garbage. I thought the P7's would outperform them so well that I'd just ditch them completely. That didn't happen. In fact, I'm now convinced that it's probably not wise to expect any competent set of headphones to be rendered obsolete by a more expensive set like these. If you have a good set already that's at least over $100 to $200 and up by well established companies like Sennheiser, V-Moda, Beyerdynamic, Bose, Audio Technica, Sony, etc. (intentionally omitting the over priced and overrated Beats), the P7's won't completely redefine good sound for you. At least they didn't for me. Once I got over that, I focused in on what they are and what they do well as much as what they do differently than what I already have. My M50X's are just a notch above neutral in bass and treble with no mids which is something I like about them. These are a different flavor altogether. The mids and lows are much more pronounced, pushing vocals to the forefront. Beck was practically singing right in front of my face when I played some of his music. Stringed instruments in classical and jazz genres also received a big boost from the extra attention. Cello's, harp's and stand up basses were much fuller than my other set ever told me. Bass kicked electronic music (Daft Punk, Deadmau5) up a few notches over my AT's as well but never got overbearing or obnoxious. I really like the deeper bass and thicker overall sound on bass heavy music but I'm not a bass head so I don't want bass drowning out the instruments and vocals either. It sounds like it's getting close to the threshold of going over the edge but never getting there. I like a lot of rock music too which is something my AT's can do very well. Most of the bands actually sounded better on them than on the P7's which is probably due to the treble coming down a couple of notches. I prefer a V shaped sound, favoring the treble and bass. In fact, I usually have the treble dialed all the way up on my EQ's, so I missed that high sizzle from cymbals and snap from the snare drums. I also couldn't distinguish all the instruments as well on harder tunes with heavier distortion on the guitars. On a particularly heavy song, the high hat cymbal was almost completely drowned out and it took my M50X's to remember how much I should be hearing it. The extra emphasis on the mids and bass made the sound fuller but muddied the separation. The P7's made most everything sound better and outperformed my M50X's just not it the rock category which is a big one for me. They came up short according to my tastes. Headphones originally priced at $400 shouldn't have such a glaring weakness. They should do everything really well but don't. That was the main reason why I had to let them go.Outside of music, the P7's also worked well with T.V. shows and movies. Vocals came through clearly and soundtracks and effects delivered a more home theater like experience. The extra oomph really delivered on action scenes and dialog was more distinguishable. My M50X's held their own while doing a direct comparison though.There are 2 cords provided and the one attached for Apple devices included controls that worked flawlessly with my iPad. The cord even feels better in comparison to others I've felt. A drawback is the included case. While it's nice to receive one and it is of the same fine leather as found on the headphones, I'm not a fan of soft cases. Especially not for expensive electronics. It'll do fine for around the house or light travel use but if you're going to put these in a suitcase or travel far and frequently, I'd have my reservations. These are well worth a little extra money to protect them from falls, drops, getting sat on or being crushed by other bags. The included soft case also looks more like one of my wife's make-up bags which is a bit of a turn off. That's a very minor gripe though.In conclusion, these are premium, luxury headphones. The look like it, feel like it, smell like it and but come short of sounding like it which is what matters most to me. If you've already invested in a decent set of headphones, they won't completely redefine portable listening for you but they'll provide you with a quality product that's physically head and shoulders above everything else I've seen on the store shelves.I still do recommend these for people who want a premium build and appreciate warmer sounds. For heavy vocals, stringed instruments, and almost everything else, they're still very good. Hard rock is their achilles heel though. I'm just like hearing that separation amongst the distortion. I now have a greater appreciation for my M50X's though. Going head to head against a high end headphone like the P7 and coming out on top is pretty remarkable and even though it was a tough decision, that was the main reason why I couldn't keep them. I just couldn't justify paying $300 for a set of headphones that didn't completely outperform my M50x's, are actually lacking the treble that I like and hurt from the extra clamping force. But they sure are nice looking. Worked Great! Yep they are expensive but very worth the money. Best set of headphones I have bought. Don't know why I waited so long to buy these! outstanding Tried the P3's, loved the sound quality but didn't like the feel on my ears after an hour or so. Decided to switch to an over the ear model and love the P7's. Vocals are crystal clear and the bass is rich without the overdone bass of many headphones. Very comfortable for long periods and with glasses on. They sound great with a tablet, phone, desktop or receiver and can play as loud as you would want without distortion with any of them. Expensive but worth it. Great big headphones even for portable players Best Headphones in the $300-$400 price range in my opinion. A little bulky but sounds better than the p5s. Lower frequency Bass is more present but not overwhelming like other headphones. Really good all around headphones and efficient too. Overpriced. Wired headphones Yes. Sound great. However. Wireless is the wave of the future. As I'm writing this. The new P7 Wireless been released. Hmmm. Same sound. These are a runner-up against the Sennheisers WIRELESS momentum The BMW of Headphones Man, do these make one heck of a first impression.

I probably would've had some buyers remorse had I paid the original $400 asking price for these but at $280 on Cyber Monday, it would take a lot to convince me that there's a better made and sounding headphone than the B&W P7. This is one of those rare times where getting what you pay for turns out to be a good thing. Highly recommended for music listeners and those who appreciate a little luxury every now and then.*Note: After Cyber Monday, the P7's went up to $350 which looks like their new standard asking price. That still seems like a pretty good deal and keeps them at the top of the heap in that price range. Clear and accurate sound. The headphones offer exceptional clear and accurate sound. The over the ear design isolates your listening environment. Very comfortable for long periods of use. If Sound Could Talk... If sound could talk, this is how it would want to be heard. I can't think of another way to describe the B&W P7s. Don't bother wasting your time with anything else. At the very least, order yourself a pair and take a listen. My money says that someone will have to pry them off your head before you'll be returning them. Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop to Jazz, pick your genre. Anything you throw at them, they'll deliver results unlike anything you have ever experience. These headphones will make you love your music again. The Holy Grail of Headphones I waited about 3 days to get my hands on a pair and believe me the wait was well worth it. I had been debating whether to go with AKG but after listening to these there was absolutely no contest. Money will spent. I feel it should have come with a better case though. Best Sounding Headphones I've Owned The P7's are the best sounding headphones I've ever owned. I personally haven't really tried any headphones in the same category, except maybe the V-Moda Crossfade, but that is $100 less and definitely inferior to the P7's.But, I think there are basically only 2 huge pros:• Sound quality is amazing and pretty neutral with a perfect amount of bass• Stylish yet solid build qualityA few minor cons:• A bit bulky if you're used to smaller headphones• Buttons on the cable aren't the best to grip (they are plastic ""lines"")• Could have included better case and accessories for the priceAll in all, I think you're paying for the sound quality here and you're definitely getting it. Unfortunately, lower quality audio files tend to be more noticeable on the P7's, but hey that's not what you're listening to with these right? Minor cons aside, the P7's sound better than anything I have ever owned or even tried.

Great great sound. Awesome Sound! These are great outdoor speakers! The sound is awesome and they are built well. I especially like the strong base sound and solid mounting brackets. awsome The look and wattage is spectacular. They are easy to set up and move around. No problems here. Great sound Bought 2 of this speakers and i am glad i did, i have Definitive Technology speakers in my home theatre room and i love them and I am still impressed with the quality of sound for outdoor speaker's. Price is a little high but still worth it!!!! These are great These are the second set of these speakers. We bought the first paid and they sound great and are loud so we got another set for the other side of the yard. Love it! I have 4 of these outside in the patio area. Very clear and rich tone. The best out door speaker ! I've had different out door speakers but these are by far the best. After I broke them in they sounded even better. Deffentlly go with deff tech! Extremely happy I recieve several compliments from friends and neighbors. The sound is crystal clear and looks s great. Throws plenty of sound around my pool area kids even say they can here when under water. Solid outdoor speaker I used mine in a cover patio. The bass fill the space nicely. Best sounding speakers for the money. Worth the money, amazing Awesome outdoor speakers if you're looking for durability. Price is great also! Just right for the party! After looking for a set of speakers that would not blow the budget, but also not sacrifice the quality of sound, we chose these D.A. outdoor speakers. The installation was easy. We have ~550sqft patio and there is plenty of sound, including bass to be felt. It is hooked up to volume control switch just inside the door running off a Denon DRA-397 which handles five sets of speakers in the house. Great speaker A little pricey, but well worth the performance. Seems to hold up to the outdoor elements very well. Bass and quality sound outdoors is no longer an issue... After buying and returning Bose products, I am happy to report that these are the answer to the outdoor sound dillema. These speaker make music sound great outside on my deck. All genres sound great and clear... Most of the murky highs and crappy lows units did not compare to much more then a boom box while with these deliver at the level of outdoor PA speakers with a 10 - 12 woofer.Don't look much farther if you're in the market for quality outdoor sound. Great outdoor speakers. Installed 4 AW 6500 speakers at our pool pavilion. Great sound - clear details, no subwoofer needed. I love bose products but these were better than bose 251.

36," Good Speakers Nice and loud good base I have no complaints with these speakers ! Not Enough Bass I bought these on the recommendation of the store salesman, sounded pretty good in a the store, however they didn't have a lot of bass when I hooked them up. I exchanged them for another brand same price range and they were great! Good product for the price Good quality but could be better!! Overall I'm happy with my purchase!!! These are GREAT speakers! I replaced all four door speakers in ... These are GREAT speakers! I replaced all four door speakers in my 2007 Silverado Crew Cab and it sounds amazing. I added a 10 inch subwoofer for some bass because despite what anyone says, 6-1/2 speakers are NOT for bass. They DO, however, play crystal clear mids and highs without any distortion at nearly full volume (so loud it hurts).I am going to buy some to replace the speakers in my wife's car next. Go ahead and buy some for yourself, you won't be disappointed. Exactly what I wanted! got these speakers on sale and they were definitely worth every penny! Great speakers They sound wonderful. A great price for a well made speaker Good for sale price paid Great replacement for VW Jetta rear door speakers. Alpine SPE-6000 Speakers - Excellent Speakers I am no audiophile but these speakers are incredible for the price. If you are into the idea that high-dollar speakers are better because they cost more then this review is not for you. I have a 2004 Mitsubishi Montereo Sport (without the Infinity system installed) and the passenger side stock speaker was blown. I decided to shop around for not only for middle-priced speakers but also a brand name that was reputatble.Not only did I get more than I bargained for, I liked them so much, I swapped out the entire SUV!I replaced the front speakers first and did a test run ( I listen to Metal music) and the sound was clean and crisp on the highs and the lows were not bad either. Don't get me wrong, you are not going to hear the lowest of the lows with these speakers but the sound quailty of the bass was more than adequate.I could definitely tell the difference between the new SPE-6000's and the stock in the back. For the price and quality, I decided I wanted to change out the rest of the vehicle. Let's say I am very pleased with these speakers and I do recommend them. My car does not have all the amps, crossovers and bells and whistles but for a good price in my opinion, these speakers were way better than expected.-SuperDave71Memphis, TN Great sound and quality!

37," A little bulky but works great! Had this in Vegas and charged 4 phone off it for most of the day so it was great not to have to find an charge station or head back to the hotel. Versatile Like the fact that that it is a charger, surge protector with multiple other uses and so portable. Would purchase again! Easy yo use compact charger This Belkin Portable charger works well and is easy to use. ITS ALRIGHT... This travel charger has a cheap build quality but considering the price it isn't a big deal. Also the plugins on it DO NOT CHARGE unless the charger is plugged in!!! So really the only thing that this charges is the 1 usb port. Plus I only get half to a full iPhone charge on a full charge of the Belkin Travel Charger. Good Works well , Keeos Phone Charged 100% while using your phone Good backup travel charger The Belkin charger is a great go to when in need of an alternative charging source. Inexpensive but well worth it. A little bulky but works great!

38," Great Sound Takes your music library to new hights!I was looking for Headphones that were a step above the high end massmarket.It was well invested money, and there is no going back, excellent sound and comfortable! CAN'T GO WRONG WITH B&W I ORIGINALLY BROUGHT THE P5s BEING CHEAP. ONCE I HEARD THE CLARITY OF THEM I JUST FELT LIKE I WAS CHEATING MYSELF INSTEAD OF SAVING THE MONEY. I DROVE PAST 2 BESTBUYS THAT DIDN'T HAVE THEM JUST TO GET THEM THE SAME DAY.I RETURNED THE P5s IN VALLEY STREAMS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE P7s. I HAVE LISTENED TO THRILLER FOR 25 YEARS, BUT I HEARD THINGS IN THE BACKGROUND THAT I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE WEARING THE P7s. Great headphones for Audiophiles When I hear sounds that I've never heard before from songs that I've been listening for years, it is a good sign. The best you can buy After shopping around a long time I couldn't find any headset that had all of the main factors I needed in a headset until I found the B & W P7. The build quality is solid. The sound is amazing. The fit over the ears is great and blocks out all ambient noise. The case is not what I would expect but it does the job. The fit over the head is a bit tight so it can be a bit uncomfortable at times. If you try these out, nothing else will satisfy you so don't even try them unless you plan to buy them. Best Headphones Ever Purchased By far the best piece of equipment I have put on my head let alone ears. Relaxing when I was on a plane, to serious and upbeat while at work. So comfortable I forget where the lovely harmonic sound is coming from. I would upgrade from the other big name headphones any day to these. The cord is a bit short for laying in bed purposes otherwise a phenomenal investment. Just Short of Greatness I really liked these and wanted to keep them because they make one heck of a first impression but I ultimately had to return them. Removing the lid of the box greets you with the unmistakable smell of brand new, genuine leather. From the thick headband to the ear cups, this baby is soft, premium leather all the way. The metal frame that connects them is strong and gives confidence that they're not going to accidentally bend or break from anything but an almost intentional force against them. Here's my first comparison to it's peers. Most every other set, even over $300 is almost completely plastic. This is solid metal and leather through and through and it's heavier than its competitors for it. That's already a striking difference and makes a good argument for a higher price tag. It's obviously a higher quality product with better materials. I also like that the ear cups are removable and magnetically attached. Should there be an unrepairable break or tear, just buy a new set and pop them on. Underneath the left cup is where the cord attaches. This is also a great idea as the port tends to get damaged when the cord is pulled or water seeps in. You can tell there was a lot of thought put towards the design. The picture doesn't do these justice. They impress from top to bottom. One thing they don't look like is something you want to sweat all over or wear on rainy days so have something else for gyms, sweltering heat and storm season outdoors. They're also softer than they look. The ear pads are filled with memory foam so they're very soft to the touch and the headband is also nicely padded. I also like the added thickness on top. They did feel good at first when I put them on, but I felt some discomfort during my hours of wearing them. The clamping pressure started to make my upper jaw, under my ear ache. They seal very well and isolate from most of the outside noise. They're easily the best noise isolating headphones I've ever put on. They fold in on both sides to fit easier in a small bag or case, making them more portable. The ear cups don't swivel though.I'll be honest here about the sound. I have to say, I came away disappointed. They don't sound bad by any means but they're warmer in the mid range that I like which sacrifices some of the treble that I'm used to. I cycled through a variety of different types of music and when comparing them directly against my Audio Technica M50X's, they didn't blow them away, which is what I was kind of expecting them to do given their price point and reputation. I then realized that it wasn't a realistic expectation because my M50X's are actually very good headphones and nothing is going to make them sound like garbage. I thought the P7's would outperform them so well that I'd just ditch them completely. That didn't happen. In fact, I'm now convinced that it's probably not wise to expect any competent set of headphones to be rendered obsolete by a more expensive set like these. If you have a good set already that's at least over $100 to $200 and up by well established companies like Sennheiser, V-Moda, Beyerdynamic, Bose, Audio Technica, Sony, etc. (intentionally omitting the over priced and overrated Beats), the P7's won't completely redefine good sound for you. At least they didn't for me. Once I got over that, I focused in on what they are and what they do well as much as what they do differently than what I already have. My M50X's are just a notch above neutral in bass and treble with no mids which is something I like about them. These are a different flavor altogether. The mids and lows are much more pronounced, pushing vocals to the forefront. Beck was practically singing right in front of my face when I played some of his music. Stringed instruments in classical and jazz genres also received a big boost from the extra attention. Cello's, harp's and stand up basses were much fuller than my other set ever told me. Bass kicked electronic music (Daft Punk, Deadmau5) up a few notches over my AT's as well but never got overbearing or obnoxious. I really like the deeper bass and thicker overall sound on bass heavy music but I'm not a bass head so I don't want bass drowning out the instruments and vocals either. It sounds like it's getting close to the threshold of going over the edge but never getting there. I like a lot of rock music too which is something my AT's can do very well. Most of the bands actually sounded better on them than on the P7's which is probably due to the treble coming down a couple of notches. I prefer a V shaped sound, favoring the treble and bass. In fact, I usually have the treble dialed all the way up on my EQ's, so I missed that high sizzle from cymbals and snap from the snare drums. I also couldn't distinguish all the instruments as well on harder tunes with heavier distortion on the guitars. On a particularly heavy song, the high hat cymbal was almost completely drowned out and it took my M50X's to remember how much I should be hearing it. The extra emphasis on the mids and bass made the sound fuller but muddied the separation. The P7's made most everything sound better and outperformed my M50X's just not it the rock category which is a big one for me. They came up short according to my tastes. Headphones originally priced at $400 shouldn't have such a glaring weakness. They should do everything really well but don't. That was the main reason why I had to let them go.Outside of music, the P7's also worked well with T.V. shows and movies. Vocals came through clearly and soundtracks and effects delivered a more home theater like experience. The extra oomph really delivered on action scenes and dialog was more distinguishable. My M50X's held their own while doing a direct comparison though.There are 2 cords provided and the one attached for Apple devices included controls that worked flawlessly with my iPad. The cord even feels better in comparison to others I've felt. A drawback is the included case. While it's nice to receive one and it is of the same fine leather as found on the headphones, I'm not a fan of soft cases. Especially not for expensive electronics. It'll do fine for around the house or light travel use but if you're going to put these in a suitcase or travel far and frequently, I'd have my reservations. These are well worth a little extra money to protect them from falls, drops, getting sat on or being crushed by other bags. The included soft case also looks more like one of my wife's make-up bags which is a bit of a turn off. That's a very minor gripe though.In conclusion, these are premium, luxury headphones. The look like it, feel like it, smell like it and but come short of sounding like it which is what matters most to me. If you've already invested in a decent set of headphones, they won't completely redefine portable listening for you but they'll provide you with a quality product that's physically head and shoulders above everything else I've seen on the store shelves.I still do recommend these for people who want a premium build and appreciate warmer sounds. For heavy vocals, stringed instruments, and almost everything else, they're still very good. Hard rock is their achilles heel though. I'm just like hearing that separation amongst the distortion. I now have a greater appreciation for my M50X's though. Going head to head against a high end headphone like the P7 and coming out on top is pretty remarkable and even though it was a tough decision, that was the main reason why I couldn't keep them. I just couldn't justify paying $300 for a set of headphones that didn't completely outperform my M50x's, are actually lacking the treble that I like and hurt from the extra clamping force. But they sure are nice looking. Worked Great! Yep they are expensive but very worth the money. Best set of headphones I have bought. Don't know why I waited so long to buy these! outstanding Tried the P3's, loved the sound quality but didn't like the feel on my ears after an hour or so. Decided to switch to an over the ear model and love the P7's. Vocals are crystal clear and the bass is rich without the overdone bass of many headphones. Very comfortable for long periods and with glasses on. They sound great with a tablet, phone, desktop or receiver and can play as loud as you would want without distortion with any of them. Expensive but worth it. Great big headphones even for portable players Best Headphones in the $300-$400 price range in my opinion. A little bulky but sounds better than the p5s. Lower frequency Bass is more present but not overwhelming like other headphones. Really good all around headphones and efficient too. Overpriced. Wired headphones Yes. Sound great. However. Wireless is the wave of the future. As I'm writing this. The new P7 Wireless been released. Hmmm. Same sound. These are a runner-up against the Sennheisers WIRELESS momentum The BMW of Headphones Man, do these make one heck of a first impression.

If you have a good set already that's at least over $100 to $200 and up by well established companies like Sennheiser, V-Moda, Beyerdynamic, Bose, Audio Technica, etc. (intentionally omitting the over priced and overrated Beats), the P7's won't completely redefine good sound for you. At least they didn't for me. Once I got over that, I focused in on what they are and what they do well as much as what they do differently than what I already have. My M50X's are just a slight notch above neutral in bass and treble with no mids which is something I like about them. These are a different flavor altogether. The mids and lows are much more pronounced, pushing vocals to the forefront. Beck was practically singing right in front of my face when I played some of his music. Stringed instruments in classical and jazz genres also received a big boost from the extra attention. Cello's, harp's and stand up basses were much fuller than my other set ever told me. Bass kicked electronic music (Daft Punk, Deadmau5) up a few notches over my AT's as well but never got overbearing or obnoxious. I really like the deeper bass and thicker overall sound on bass heavy music but I'm not a bass head so I don't want bass drowning out the instruments and vocals either. It sounds like it's right on the threshold of going over the edge but never getting there. I like a lot of rock music too which is something my AT's can do very well. A few bands actually sounded better on them than on the P7's which is probably due to the treble coming down a couple of notches. I prefer a V shaped sound, favoring the treble and bass. In fact, I usually have the treble dialed all the way up on my EQ's, so I missed that high sizzle from cymbals and snap from the snare drums. I also couldn't distinguish all the instruments as well on harder tunes with heavier distortion on the guitars. The push to the mids made the sound fuller but muddied the separation a little more. For most everything, The P7's did everything better and outperformed my M50X's. They just came up a little short a few times according to my tastes.Outside of music, the P7's also worked great with T.V. shows and movies. Vocals came through clearly and soundtracks and effects delivered a more home theater like experience. The extra oomph really delivered on action scenes and dialog was more distinguishable.There are 2 cords provided and the one attached for Apple devices included controls that worked flawlessly with my iPad and iPod. The cord even feels better in comparison to others I've felt. My one drawback is the included case. While it's nice to receive one and it is of the same fine leather as found on the headphones, I'm not a fan of soft cases. Especially not for expensive electronics. It'll do fine for around the house or light travel use but if you're going to put these in a suitcase or travel far and frequently, I'd have my reservations. I'm ordering a hard case for just such uses. These are well worth a little extra money to protect them from falls, drops, getting sat on or being crushed by other bags. The included soft case also looks more like one of my wife's make-up bags which is a bit of a turn off. That's a very minor gripe though.In conclusion, these are premium, luxury headphones. The look like it, feel like it, smell like it and sound like it. If you use or have already invested in a decent set of headphones, they won't completely redefine portable listening for you but they'll provide you with a quality product that's head and shoulders above everything else I've seen on the store shelves. I probably would've had some buyers remorse had I paid the original $400 asking price for these but at $280 on Cyber Monday, it would take a lot to convince me that there's a better made and sounding headphone than the B&W P7. This is one of those rare times where getting what you pay for turns out to be a good thing. Highly recommended for music listeners and those who appreciate a little luxury every now and then.*Note: After Cyber Monday, the P7's went up to $350 which looks like their new standard asking price. That still seems like a pretty good deal and keeps them at the top of the heap in that price range. Clear and accurate sound. The headphones offer exceptional clear and accurate sound. The over the ear design isolates your listening environment. Very comfortable for long periods of use. If Sound Could Talk... If sound could talk, this is how it would want to be heard. I can't think of another way to describe the B&W P7s. Don't bother wasting your time with anything else. At the very least, order yourself a pair and take a listen. My money says that someone will have to pry them off your head before you'll be returning them. Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop to Jazz, pick your genre. Anything you throw at them, they'll deliver results unlike anything you have ever experience. These headphones will make you love your music again. The Holy Grail of Headphones I waited about 3 days to get my hands on a pair and believe me the wait was well worth it. I had been debating whether to go with AKG but after listening to these there was absolutely no contest. Money will spent. I feel it should have come with a better case though. Best Sounding Headphones I've Owned The P7's are the best sounding headphones I've ever owned. I personally haven't really tried any headphones in the same category, except maybe the V-Moda Crossfade, but that is $100 less and definitely inferior to the P7's.But, I think there are basically only 2 huge pros:• Sound quality is amazing and pretty neutral with a perfect amount of bass• Stylish yet solid build qualityA few minor cons:• A bit bulky if you're used to smaller headphones• Buttons on the cable aren't the best to grip (they are plastic ""lines"")• Could have included better case and accessories for the priceAll in all, I think you're paying for the sound quality here and you're definitely getting it. Unfortunately, lower quality audio files tend to be more noticeable on the P7's, but hey that's not what you're listening to with these right? Minor cons aside, the P7's sound better than anything I have ever owned or even tried. Great Sound Takes your music library to new hights!I was looking for Headphones that were a step above the high end massmarket.It was well invested money, and there is no going back, excellent sound and comfortable! CAN'T GO WRONG WITH B&W I ORIGINALLY BROUGHT THE P5s BEING CHEAP. ONCE I HEARD THE CLARITY OF THEM I JUST FELT LIKE I WAS CHEATING MYSELF INSTEAD OF SAVING THE MONEY. I DROVE PAST 2 BESTBUYS THAT DIDN'T HAVE THEM JUST TO GET THEM THE SAME DAY.I RETURNED THE P5s IN VALLEY STREAMS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE P7s. I HAVE LISTENED TO THRILLER FOR 25 YEARS, BUT I HEARD THINGS IN THE BACKGROUND THAT I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE WEARING THE P7s. Great headphones for Audiophiles When I hear sounds that I've never heard before from songs that I've been listening for years, it is a good sign. The best you can buy After shopping around a long time I couldn't find any headset that had all of the main factors I needed in a headset until I found the B & W P7. The build quality is solid. The sound is amazing. The fit over the ears is great and blocks out all ambient noise. The case is not what I would expect but it does the job. The fit over the head is a bit tight so it can be a bit uncomfortable at times. If you try these out, nothing else will satisfy you so don't even try them unless you plan to buy them. Best Headphones Ever Purchased By far the best piece of equipment I have put on my head let alone ears. Relaxing when I was on a plane, to serious and upbeat while at work. So comfortable I forget where the lovely harmonic sound is coming from. I would upgrade from the other big name headphones any day to these. The cord is a bit short for laying in bed purposes otherwise a phenomenal investment. Just Short of Greatness I really liked these and wanted to keep them because they make one heck of a first impression but I ultimately had to return them. Removing the lid of the box greets you with the unmistakable smell of brand new, genuine leather. From the thick headband to the ear cups, this baby is soft, premium leather all the way. The metal frame that connects them is strong and gives confidence that they're not going to accidentally bend or break from anything but an almost intentional force against them. Here's my first comparison to it's peers. Most every other set, even over $300 is almost completely plastic. This is solid metal and leather through and through and it's heavier than its competitors for it. That's already a striking difference and makes a good argument for a higher price tag. It's obviously a higher quality product with better materials. I also like that the ear cups are removable and magnetically attached. Should there be an unrepairable break or tear, just buy a new set and pop them on. Underneath the left cup is where the cord attaches. This is also a great idea as the port tends to get damaged when the cord is pulled or water seeps in. You can tell there was a lot of thought put towards the design. The picture doesn't do these justice. They impress from top to bottom. One thing they don't look like is something you want to sweat all over or wear on rainy days so have something else for gyms, sweltering heat and storm season outdoors. They're also softer than they look. The ear pads are filled with memory foam so they're very soft to the touch and the headband is also nicely padded. I also like the added thickness on top. They did feel good at first when I put them on, but I felt some discomfort during my hours of wearing them. The clamping pressure started to make my upper jaw, under my ear ache. They seal very well and isolate from most of the outside noise. They're easily the best noise isolating headphones I've ever put on. They fold in on both sides to fit easier in a small bag or case, making them more portable. The ear cups don't swivel though.I'll be honest here about the sound. I have to say, I came away disappointed. They don't sound bad by any means but they're warmer in the mid range that I like which sacrifices some of the treble that I'm used to. I cycled through a variety of different types of music and when comparing them directly against my Audio Technica M50X's, they didn't blow them away, which is what I was kind of expecting them to do given their price point and reputation. I then realized that it wasn't a realistic expectation because my M50X's are actually very good headphones and nothing is going to make them sound like garbage. I thought the P7's would outperform them so well that I'd just ditch them completely. That didn't happen. In fact, I'm now convinced that it's probably not wise to expect any competent set of headphones to be rendered obsolete by a more expensive set like these. If you have a good set already that's at least over $100 to $200 and up by well established companies like Sennheiser, V-Moda, Beyerdynamic, Bose, Audio Technica, Sony, etc. (intentionally omitting the over priced and overrated Beats), the P7's won't completely redefine good sound for you. At least they didn't for me. Once I got over that, I focused in on what they are and what they do well as much as what they do differently than what I already have.

In fact, I usually have the treble dialed all the way up on my EQ's, so I missed that high sizzle from cymbals and snap from the snare drums. I also couldn't distinguish all the instruments as well on harder tunes with heavier distortion on the guitars. On a particularly heavy song, the high hat cymbal was almost completely drowned out and it took my M50X's to remember how much I should be hearing it. The extra emphasis on the mids and bass made the sound fuller but muddied the separation. The P7's made most everything sound better and outperformed my M50X's just not it the rock category which is a big one for me. They came up short according to my tastes. Headphones originally priced at $400 shouldn't have such a glaring weakness. They should do everything really well but don't. That was the main reason why I had to let them go.Outside of music, the P7's also worked well with T.V. shows and movies. Vocals came through clearly and soundtracks and effects delivered a more home theater like experience. The extra oomph really delivered on action scenes and dialog was more distinguishable. My M50X's held their own while doing a direct comparison though.There are 2 cords provided and the one attached for Apple devices included controls that worked flawlessly with my iPad. The cord even feels better in comparison to others I've felt. A drawback is the included case. While it's nice to receive one and it is of the same fine leather as found on the headphones, I'm not a fan of soft cases. Especially not for expensive electronics.

The included soft case also looks more like one of my wife's make-up bags which is a bit of a turn off. That's a very minor gripe though.In conclusion, these are premium, luxury headphones. The look like it, feel like it, smell like it and but come short of sounding like it which is what matters most to me. If you've already invested in a decent set of headphones, they won't completely redefine portable listening for you but they'll provide you with a quality product that's physically head and shoulders above everything else I've seen on the store shelves.I still do recommend these for people who want a premium build and appreciate warmer sounds. For heavy vocals, stringed instruments, and almost everything else, they're still very good. Hard rock is their achilles heel though. I'm just like hearing that separation amongst the distortion. I now have a greater appreciation for my M50X's though. Going head to head against a high end headphone like the P7 and coming out on top is pretty remarkable and even though it was a tough decision, that was the main reason why I couldn't keep them. I just couldn't justify paying $300 for a set of headphones that didn't completely outperform my M50x's, are actually lacking the treble that I like and hurt from the extra clamping force. But they sure are nice looking. Worked Great! Yep they are expensive but very worth the money. Best set of headphones I have bought. Don't know why I waited so long to buy these! outstanding Tried the P3's, loved the sound quality but didn't like the feel on my ears after an hour or so. Decided to switch to an over the ear model and love the P7's. Vocals are crystal clear and the bass is rich without the overdone bass of many headphones. Very comfortable for long periods and with glasses on. They sound great with a tablet, phone, desktop or receiver and can play as loud as you would want without distortion with any of them. Expensive but worth it. Great big headphones even for portable players Best Headphones in the $300-$400 price range in my opinion. A little bulky but sounds better than the p5s. Lower frequency Bass is more present but not overwhelming like other headphones. Really good all around headphones and efficient too. Overpriced. Wired headphones Yes. Sound great. However. Wireless is the wave of the future. As I'm writing this. The new P7 Wireless been released. Hmmm. Same sound. These are a runner-up against the Sennheisers WIRELESS momentum The BMW of Headphones Man, do these make one heck of a first impression.

This worked wonderfully and I would recommend it. Loud enough for old folks I looked at a lot of options for a loud ringer and found this one. It does the job. It will keep me from missing calls. Most modern phones have soft rings that cannot be heard over TV and other background noise when the phone is in another room. Good buy.

42," Doing their Job I purchased 3 of these to use in. Qnap nas. I chose WD red due to their reputation of reliability. I have had a few WD red drive in other devices and they have all held up without issues.So far so good on all 3 drives. I trust my content living on these drives. Good for the price 2 TB for the price of $84.99 It was a great deal during this time but price might have went up. 2 TB is decent amount of space. If you do a lot of video editing and Fraps recording, I would suggest you get a bigger space, I'd say a 4TB. Unit works great so far. I have purchased 7 of these between two Lenovo Ts440 Servers, one is for a replacement. So far they have all been performing just fine. I have had no issues and I would recommend these drives, Western Digital does have a new version out now. Using these in QNAP NAS I ordered 8 of these drives for some QNAP NASes and did not have any problems out of them. They are definitely better quality than the Green and Blue WD drives. Great product! Great Price! Was pleasantly surprised to find that Best Buy's sale price on the hard drive was lower than many popular computer hardware retailers. These hard drives are great for a DIY home NAS build. Speedy Seems like fast access and if like my other WD Red drives, it should be reliable. Nothing but positive at this point! Good Drive Drive works well but it is NOT designed to be a desktop hard drive this drive is designed for NAS boxes. It will work in a desktop drive but windows may report errors due to the way the HDD is designed. Great for my NAS I have a bunch of these in two NAS units. They have never let me down.

43," Nice and Fast! Internet speed good from basement. Kind of big but does the job. Great product This is one of the best wireless adapters I’ve ever used. Awesome adapter I've had this adapter for about 2 months and I am amazed at just how fast it is. My speed test are over 100mbs every time I run one. Awesome!!!! Excellent device- easy to set up Love it. Speed is very good. Price is fair and it does the job. Super easy to hook up this was very easy to hook up to my computer. I am very happy with the purchase Works better then I thought! I have an old dell tower computer. So I thought with a newer item like this it would take some time to install but I was wrong it’s pretty much plug and play. Seems to work better then my other wireless devices as far as internet speed. Great signal improvement My router is located on opposite side of the house and with plaster walls signal quality was poor when using the laptops embedded Wi-Fi MIC. Purchased this in hopes of obtaining better signal quality and it was a great improvement Great adapter I was hesitant because I thought this couldn't compare to a PCI Express analog, but I'm relieved that it performs great. Awesome wifi usb adapter I have an older computer, and could not connect to 5g. with this I can Great speed and range Had really good speed, didnt have interruptions at all. Easy to use Probably the easiest component to set up on my computer and not hard to install. Big Help The wifi on my laptop went kaputt. Buying this prevented me from purchasing a new computer. Did what it was supposed to. The unit was a little bulky. I did not experience the advertised bust in productivity. Installation was quick and easy. Fastest Adapter Yet My old USB adapter was the Netgear A6210 and I thought connecting at 833MB/s was fast. With the A7000, I now connect at 1.3GB/s (1300MB/s). Amazing Upgrade from Almost Anything I have an extremely high-end motherboard with built-in AC WiFi in a custom-built. Typically going from N to AC is enough for most people. But using this Nighthawk A7000/AC1900 boosted my download speeds more than 5x. Cannot suggest this enough for anyone. Great product Device works perfectly just plug and play. Item is a little bulky. Impressed My son bought this for a computer he was building. We were amazed by how this adapter increased his signal. Would definitely recommend it. Get it for dank internet speeds Some people can't wire a long Ethernet cord around the house and this is a good replacement. Just make sure your router and your internet speed works with it. Excellent covg, easy install I use this with my Nighthawk router and the coverage is excellent. 5 bars by the pool 100' away. Highly recommend. Very Fast and Easy to Setup So far after a little bit of time using this wireless adapter it seems the be the best one I have found to date. Its super easy and quick to setup (drivers found on website for those without DVD drive) and provides a secure, very fast connection. The magnetic stand that come with is very useful and the magnet is strong so it wont move around. Nighthawk is some of the best products I've seen and definitely recommend to everyone. No complaints Works as advertised on the website we are working on the net now. Nice and Fast! Internet speed good from basement. Kind of big but does the job.

Get it for dank internet speeds Some people can't wire a long Ethernet cord around the house and this is a good replacement. Just make sure your router and your internet speed works with it. Excellent covg, easy install I use this with my Nighthawk router and the coverage is excellent. 5 bars by the pool 100' away. Highly recommend. Very Fast and Easy to Setup So far after a little bit of time using this wireless adapter it seems the be the best one I have found to date. Its super easy and quick to setup (drivers found on website for those without DVD drive) and provides a secure, very fast connection. The magnetic stand that come with is very useful and the magnet is strong so it wont move around. Nighthawk is some of the best products I've seen and definitely recommend to everyone. No complaints Works as advertised on the website we are working on the net now."

45," Three Stars Do what it's supposed to do. Reaction time of the remote control can be faster. Programming via the computer was an arduous and timely process ... Programming via the computer was an arduous and timely process, there was significant lag between clicking and the program registering the input. Don't know about you, but we need this! I have had a logitech harmony remote for about 10 years and wouldn't want to have to deal without one. One touch turns on the TV and my Sony sound system/dvd player and the it is ready to watch tv by controlling my Tivo and volume etc. This new one has updated features like a touch screen and it is taking some time for me to get used to. It functions differently than my previous model but is much more flexible and can do much more with less programming. I think this one might be easier (less techy) to set up because now you don't have to do so much of your own programming, but instead you have to learn how to use the devices feature. But in the end, we watch a samsung tv, change the channels on a Tivo and control surround sound from our Sony home theater and if we chose to, we can record a program on our Toshiba DVD burner using nothing but this one Logitech programmable remote. Five Stars gave as a gift Five Stars Good Maybe mine is a dud First let me say I bought my Harmony Ultimate One from Dell, not Amazon. I had been using a harmony remote with fewer functions and really liked it.But I've had so much trouble with this one. This remote has a feature that you press if the remote didn't carry out all the steps you asked it to perform. For instance, if you want to watch roku, the remote is supposed to turn on the television and sound bar and change the television HDMI to the one that Roku is on. I'd say 6 out of 10 times, I've had to ask Harmony to fix it. Eventually, it does fix it, but as often as not, it takes several attempts. About 50 of the time, the off button doesn't work. And finally, there's not much life to the battery.....and that's been true from the get-go. I really wish I hadn't bought this thing! The most infuriating remote I've ever used. The button ... The most infuriating remote I've ever used. The button layout is an ergonomic nightmare. The weight distribution is so uneven, it falls constantly - off a table, off an armchair, out of your hand. The back is so over contoured and slick that you have to place it face down to stay on anything but a completely flat surface, but then you risk triggering the absurdly sensitive touch screen. Oh, the touch screen!!!! Be careful not to breathe on the damn thing or you'll be restarting your system or changing functions constantly and without warning. Did I mention that the battery life is godawful and you must charge it - no removable battery option. Avoid at all costs. Bought the Harmony 700 at Best Buy its working great Four weeks of frustration trying to set it up. Customer service is only via email and most of their solutions were generic. Gave up returned it. Bought the Harmony 700 at Best Buy its working great! Five Stars Superb ! Five Stars East to program off the internet for a non-stereo component expert. It waste time at start up updating my device when there ... For such an expensive device, the software is pure stupidity. It waste time at start up updating my device when there is nothing to update. I mean, wait until I change something, then update.That said, I have to fall back on my device remotes everyday because this device is little more that an on switch.I wish I had saved my money. Absolutely fantastic remote, easy to setup Absolutely fantastic remote, easy to setup, tons of features! And if you have an existing Harmony remote you can just transfer your settings right over the new one with no fuss. Not happy with this item it doesn't work as well as ... Not happy with this item it doesn't work as well as my old one. I have problems with the touchscreen This ruins the Harmony product line for me. Of all the Harmony remotes that I've owned over the years, this is by far my least favorite.Weaknesses:Lack of physical number buttons (This is of course a design choice by Harmony. I just don't like it)Lack of IR spread - This remote must be pointed directly at the devices you're trying to controlSlowness - Takes a long time to turn all the devices on. This used to be a configurable setting in the old software.Software usability - Compared to the old harmony software, the new version is watered down regarding functionality and lacks usability / intuitiveness.Operational issues - I have to hard reset this thing once a week or so because the screen stops turning offStrengths:Controls all my IR devicesPrice was good as I got it on saleI'll look elsewhere when it comes time to replace this.Harmony remotes I've owned in the past for various family members / locations. Of all of these, this is the worst:Harmony 1 - The best by farHarmony Touch - Very similar to the Ultimate in feel but works way better.Harmony 700 - Solid and affordableHarmony 880 - Great remote until the dog got itThere's another silver version that I haven't had to mess with in so long I even forget the model . Excellent product! I am not tech savvy at all ... Excellent product! I am not tech savvy at all and this is so easy to use. I LOVE IT!!! Not worth it Found myself not really using this anymore. Touch screen is a nice idea, but I've found that I prefer just remembering where the buttons are so I don't have to look at my remote so often to see what I'm pushing. Great Remote Once you get the hang of it, it's amazing! I love this remote I love this remote. It synced with my TV, cable box and sonos sound bar. I can now control all my devices with one remote. It also allows me to use my smart tv functions like Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu. Great remote! Pays for itself In battery savings alone this remote pays for itself. Just look around your house and you will see how much battery dependency you have alreeady Almost there I got this through the vine program.We already have the Ultimate + hub for our living room. So I got this for our bedroom setup.Set up. Amazingly easy and the Logitech database of electronics they can support is extensive and even had my old Westinghouse monitor. Updating the firmware is painless too.Use. This is where Logitech comes up a little short thus the 4 stars. The touch screen is either too sensitive or not sensitive enough. Sometimes when I swipe or click a button it works and other times it doesn't. I really don't know what I am doing wrong. But the touch screen and the several pages (swipe left/right) really makes things convenient.Also provides the 30 second fast forward for my Comcast DVR and 15 second jump back.An incredibly impressive piece of hardware. Battery life is great. And firmware updates come fast and regularly. Get it. You won't be disappointed! WOW! What a great remote.I bought a new Samsung Soundbar that for whatever reason Samsung didn't design it to turn on AND off with the TV. It was one or the other depending on how you connected it (Optical or HDMI). I spoke with a co-worker who raved about this remote and thought that it might work. I gave it a try and to my amazement, it worked!Not only that, but it also easily controls all of my devices.Would highly recommend. Five Stars Works great. Love it. Buy it now to get rid of multiple remotes! Second remote and it's as great as the first with the hub. Cannot go wrong with this for all your entertainment needs in any room. This one is in our living room but it works just as well as the original with hub in our bedroom. Five Stars It is the best product. I am really satisfied. Very useful but needs a headphone jack This is a preliminary review after a week or so of use. I have now retired five remotes including my previous Logitech Harmony 510. The remote has a nice feel and is easy to operate. Occasionally, it skips. By that I mean, when I choose one thing, I get another, but infrequently and it is not a major problem.It takes a while to find something but I am sure this will improve with use. The learning curve is probably more steep than with the 510 and I'm still searching for things however, the menu layout is reasonably logical so that is a help. One thing I miss from my 510 is the ability to skip forward 30 seconds or backwards 10 seconds when watching a recording. That is an extremely useful tool that should be incorporated in the next model...or did I miss itAnother thing I really wish could be incorporated into remotes, including this one, is the feature on the Roku remote: a headset plugin capability. This is extremely useful since it eliminates long cords. Perhaps future models.Overall, I am quite (not yet very) happy with the HUO remote and expect to continue using it for a number of years. Not recommended We have always bought Harmony remotes and Were very happy with them. However, this remote is a Big disappointment. Not easy to Set up. Not easy to use at all. To much screen swiping to get to the function you want. Screen is too sensitive. Buttons are small and easy to mistress. Not happy with his purchase. I do not recommend. Dissappointed I downloaded the Harmony software. I setup the tv and cable box then hit the sync button. It didn't sync. I tried on another computer. Same thing. I called support and followed their instructions. Same problem. Called tech once more. Same instructions. Tried once more. Same problem. Disappointed. I have a Harmony 6 years old and have never had a problem. I returned the Ultimate. Piece of junk!! This is an update from a previous review. I have had this remote for about a year now and it is absolute garbage. There is not one single time that it operates as programed and I don't have to use the help button to finish the programmed function. The remote has been programmed multiple times and all of the functions work but not with the push of one button like it's supposed to, you always have to use help. This remote is a complete let down and a waste of 250. Do not waste your money. Good Products, When attempting to get a refund for ... Good Products, When attempting to get a refund for the difference on a sale it was a hassle and did not work out but I am super happy with the device. Easy to program and custom setting Easy to program and custom setting. (also work with Android TV box)Cons: Can't have different list of favorite channels. (Direct TV, TV antenna). Harmony 700 can do. Works great for me I never thought I could get excited over a remote control, but I did with this one. First of all, let me state that I was on the fence after reading the reviews here on Amazon, but I took the plunge and so far I'm not regretting it. This is my first Harmony remote, so I obviously can't make comparisons with previous models which might have been better than the unit presently under review.It took me 30 to 45 minutes to set up and sync my new remote through the Harmony software. That was a breeze, but it's important that you know your system and how its individual components are connected to each other. All my components were supported by the remote, so no problems there. I was able to customize the background image on the touchscreen. A nice touch, though not very important.Once the first sync from software to remote is completed, the remote will work on your system. As opposed to the previous situation, where you had four remotes lying around, you will now hit one button ('activity') and your TV, AV receiver and third component will turn on all at once. Great! At first this does not work flawlessly. For instance, you hit 'Watch TV' and everything might come on, but the AV receiver won't be on the right channel. The great thing about this remote, though, is that it learns on the job: It will ask you if the function performed as desired, and if not, how it can improve. After my initial use with every component, these flaws were pretty much ironed out. I now have a perfect remote with no issues whatsoever.One downside to all this automation is that the Harmony cannot predict when you've been fooling around with your equipment behind its back. Turned off your TV by hand using that device's own power button The Harmony doesn't know, so when you switch everything off through the remote (again: just ONE button), your TV will come back on again. You can work around this by customizing the color buttons on the bottom of the remote to be separate power on/off buttons for the individual components. You'll need to customize these buttons for every programmed activity, so there's an initial time investment involved. And of course there are no markings for these functions on the remote, so you'll have to memorize everything. All in all this is not ideal.If you want to nitpick, a few other minor cons are: 1) the sluggish touchscreen and 2) slightly flimsy buttons. This is nothing I can get worked up about.None of the downsides mentioned above can put a damper on my excitement. I'm very happy with this product. I'm still a tiny bit worried about the negative reviews and, subsequently, the longevity of this remote. Time will tell, and I'll adjust my rating if this thing fails within the first year or so. So far I'd highly recommend it. Great product! Definitely disappointed This is my second Logitech Harmony remote. I had my first one for eight years and loved it.I HATE this remote!!!Yes hate.Honestly, I don't even think it should be in the same category as my old Harmony remote. This version is a significant downgrade. The buttons have far less customization, the our old remote. The layout of the buttons on the remote lack a comfortable feel and placement. The removal of the number buttons in favor of the touch screen might not seem like a big deal. But instead of being about to press in 300 for your favorite channel you now need to: Touch the Screen Swipe to unlock If it doesn't come up to the number screen you have to flip through the screens to find the numbers Then enter the 300Who at Logitech thought doubling the number of keystrokes needed made any sense at all I certainly don't!I will say, this remote does eliminate the need for multiple remotes. But the downsides of this remote really don't make me happy about the amount of money that it cost. Now everything is fine, as long as I make sure to keep ... Took some time to set everything up. It had some problems with my TV (somehow skipping some inputs when switching modes) but that started working at some point (not sure what exactly I changed). Now everything is fine, as long as I make sure to keep pointing the remote to the devices while it is doing 'its thing' which takes longer than normal remotes. Five Stars Works great and easy to set up It was easy to hook up to our 4 different units We've been using it for about a month now and no complaints. It was easy to hook up to our 4 different units, also it has a learn feature so if there is something that's not working right you can customize it and make it work better. It is not getting better all the time. I purchased this to replace my Harmony one, which I loved. This remote was more expensive and vastly inferior. The ergonomics are terrible. The remote cannot be operated effectively with one hand. To reach the hard buttons at the top, one invariably activates the touch screen by mistake. In general, there are too few hard buttons (like HELP) requiring you to look down at the touch screen unnecessarily. In addition, the touch screen is not sensitive enough and frequently does not recognize taps. The swipe feature (which is nice in theory) is also not sensitive and often requires do-overs. After 4 months of babying (i.e., not letting the kids use it), the top half of the touch screen no longer worked at all. Subsequently found out that free technical support in the US is only available for 90 days (unlike Europe and Asia, which have 2 years and 1 year free phone support respectively). Without technical support, I was close to returning this, but with a little self-help persistence on the website, I was able to figure out how to reboot it (which solved the problem). Still, it should not have to be this difficult. Charging for technical support during the warranty period is a poor business model. Hope this company gets its act back together. Fantastic product - wish I had sprung for this sooner! Brilliant product. I have a somewhat more advanced home entertainment setup with a AV receiver, Roku, DVD, and fairly new Motorola DVR from FiOS and this configured and handled them all perfectly - the first time I set it up.The genius of the product is that it's programmed online and Logitech has thousands of components already identified - and they allow you to check in advance if your devices are directly supported with a look-up utility on their site. I wasn't sure about my Pioneer VSX-33TX THX receiver as it's probably 10 years old, but it was no problem. You connect the remote to your computer, Windows 7 found the drivers online without issue, then go to the Logitech setup site and create an account if you don't already have one. Then you type in the model numbers of everything that you have. If your setup is simple that may be all you need to do, but they take care of multiple 'keypress' needs very elegantly. For example, to play a DVD I have to change the plasma display to HDMI 2, set the AV receiver to DVD input, then turn on the DVD. Logitech's setup anticipated the devices and the inputs that I'd probably be using so all I needed to do was to confirm and save. Then a single touch to the onscreen display on the Harmony does it all.Be aware that like most IR remotes, it wants a pretty straight line-of-site to the components and any glass in between will weaken the signal. My components are all in a cabinet with glass doors about 12 feet from our seating area and remote control wasn't a problem although it was necessary to be pointing fairly directly at the cabinet. If you're not sure about distances or want to be lazy when aiming, pick up and install an IR repeater and it will solve that problem.Honestly, I have nothing negative to say about this device. The ergonomics and setup are inspired and so human friendly that even my wife was impressed. The 200 seems expensive initially but if you consider programming a typical button-only remote can take hours and I had this set up in 15 minutes, it quickly seems like money well spent. If you are a tech junkie like me you will love this remote. This is a great product once you get it all set up. The set up process is a bit time consuming but once it is up and running it works great. If you are a tech junkie like me you will love this remote. Maybe, Maybe Not But Logitech Stands Behind Their Product To preface my review, I am not a technophobe and have programmed other Harmony remotes.After hours of programming and re-reprogramming the remote it still does not operate properly. When I think I have the problem solved the remote fails to perform a basic function like turning on or off my devices. Based on my experience this remote is not as easy as 1-2-3-4 to set up. This is a shame because the remote has some really nice features but all the great features in the world are of no value if the remote doesn't perform basic functions.You might wonder why not call customer service. I did and here is my experience. The bright spot about contacting customer service was that I was able to reach someone without waiting an hour to speak with someone. Also I called at 4:30 pm a half-hour before the service center closes and the customer serve rep worked with me past closing time. Bottom line was the customer service rep attempted to help me and went as far as remotely changing settings on the remote on-line which only made the problem worse. At one point I had to take a quick call and explained that I would put the rep on hold and be right back. As soon as I put the call on hold the rep hung up. No call back in case it was an accidental disconnect. I called back only to find the service center was closed. I was left standing there with my remote in my hand. A remote that did not operate. I was able to re-program the remote so it could operate albeit not properly.I can't recommend this product and urge you not to purchase this product. Clearly the product does not work as advertised and their customer service is pathetic. I will contact customer no-service this week when i have the time and update this review. But in the meantime don't waste your time or money on this remote.Update -We'll it has been almost a week since I wrote my review. Just to be clear none of my components or TV are concealed and well within range. Someone from Logitech contacted me via email (no phone). Unfortunately I am extremely busy during the week and could not speak to Ian Crowe although I did call Logitech in California and left a voice mail for Ian this afternoon. I tried to work with Logitech's customer no-service today. I spoke to someone off-shore somewhere. No help. In fact he tried to tell me my remote was an RF remote. Just to make sure this tech rep was wrong I called Vizio to ensure the remote was an IR remote. It is. Sadly I am still where I was last week. Sending me an email offering to help me is great but I need solutions not empty offers to help. Ian please call me.2nd Update - I have been working with Logitech's Senior Manager for Customer Service in the Bay Area, for the past two Fridays. It looks like the problem has been solved (crossing my fingers). I really appreciate the time and effort that Ian has made to make things right. Logitech is sending an optional hub to try in case the current fix does not work. If I have to return the remote Ian has promised a refund even if I return the remote after 30 days. I hope I don't have to use the hub or return the remote. If I have to return the remote it is not because of Logitech's not trying. I really believe that Ian has gone above and beyond what would be expected.The Bottom Line: This remote might be buggy depending on your AV equipment. But when it works, it works great. So far I really like using the remote. I especially like the favorites screen. I think my tech challenged wife will be able to use the remote too. Logitech has stepped up and helped make a bad situation a good one. I would recommend Logitech to a friend or family member. I changed the title of my review and gave the remote 3 stars from 1 star. Give this a product a shot understanding there could be a problem but Logitech will work with you to make it right. I hope the current fix works and I won't have to return the remote it really is great to use. Great produce Easy to setup, work great. Rate AAA+ Awful design, terrible programming app, poor compatibility Terrible product, if you have ever tried the original Harmony One. Starting with the MyHarmony Windows app (or the browser equivalent myharmony.com) that offer a lot less programmability than the old Harmony Remote Software. Importing existing settings from previous remotes is far from accurate. The Ultimate One was unable to control a Pioneer Elite TV, a Linksys DMA 2200 media center extender, and to understand that I have my media center PC always on. Marred by several device incompatibility and by awful, awful design: how practical is it to have the Play/Pause Skip/Back buttons on top To use the playback controls means pushing buttons at the tip of the remote, so it is not firmly in your hand. Therefore, no one-hand wielding and thumb controls: you need one hand to hold the remote steady and the other to push buttons. The ffwd/skipfwd button combo is not good, despite the haptic feedback, as the extended press is a waste of time and not very accurate because of lag. The touchscreen menus are confusing, bare and unappealing. The scrolling system not very sensitive. I do not want to have to swipe the touchscreen every time I want to access some info or programmed function. It's just another annoying step. There are a hundred more negative things I could say about it. I strongly disliked it, despite being a fan of the half dozen other Harmony remotes that I have programmed over nearly ten years. Not their best effort.... The technology freezes and loops. It also fails toporperly set or turn off single devices in sets. This causes you to have to do troubleshooting and a manual fix. Ready to Purchase I looked at this remote 2 days ago and decided to try the Harmony 650 first to confirm that Logitech's infra red system would with our equipment and because it does I came back to purchase one of these too however, the price jumped by nearly 40.00.Lower the price and I am a customer of this remote too FWIW, the Harmony 650 works flawlessly.Thank you Five Stars Easy to use, great replacement for our old model. Competent but for the premium price lacking premium functionality Okay, semi expert here. This is my fourth Harmony universal remote in about ten years. Perhaps that leads to conclusions about issues of longevity I'm a little torn on that. Yes, they do get daily work, but a little more in the build quality, especially for the steep price, seems warranted. Battery life on the previous models was also not good - I am talking about rechargeable models.Sadly, nobody makes as usable as a remote as Logitech/Harmony. If I am wrong please tell me in the comments - I am willing to switch!While easy to use, easy to set up is not the same thing. If you are tech savvy, it is not too difficult and the biggest challenge is first, getting all your correct model numbers for all your gear, second, knowing enough about how you have all this set up in terms of both audio and video inputs and outputs. Advice, write it down and keep it on file. That is a fair amount of work and takes some knowledge. Unlike my last model, the default button setup for this and my different devices was a bit off. I had to customize button settings for my cable box (FIOS) to properly use the Favorites guide and a few other things including On Demand - that's right, no default button set up for On Demand. In actual use my wife was able to start using it right away, but there are some quibbles here and there on having this be the only remote we need. Back to cable, but some often used functions, like search, are more cumbersome with this than the FIOS remote. We can live with it and let that stay in a drawer, but again, for 250 I think we can all demand a bit more thoughtfulness and user testing. Not to be AV elitist, but I don't think your average person with an average set up is going to shell out 250 for a remote. We want ease of use, but also versatility. FYI, I am running this with a HD TV, audio video receiver and a 5.1 surround setup, FIOS cable box, Roku 4, blueray DVD player and (for old family stuff I am working to convert) an actual VHS VCR!P.S. Swipe gesture thing is a gimmick and not very useful - volume buttons are easier to use. Would have much rather had the effort of this go into lower cost or functionality. Form factor/ergonomics is not the best either. Volume, channel, guide - highly used buttons not in a natural position for the hand. Hire a real Human Factors person please! Five Stars Great product, great price. Great Investment! Probably one of the best investments I could have gotten. Glad it can control my WD TV. The first time I've use only one remote in a long time. Great idea poor engineering Like most people I hate having seven remotes to control my system so combining them into one unit is a great idea. I appreciate the opportunity to review the Ultimate One and compare it to my two-year-old One with the failing buttons. Although the Ultimate One is pretty smart and quite functional in many ways, Logitech misses the mark for me on several important points.Software: Try finding Roku for the Harmony. There are several classifications to look under but none of them make sense for Roku. It's listed under DVD. Go figure. Try Apple TV. Good luck with that one. Brand new hardware (Ultimate One) with the same old crappy software. If they spent a couple of days with a new software team leader in charge, maybe they'd come up with a better system, but this one has irritated me since I bought the old One more than two years ago.Hardware: Improved the shape and size over the old One so that now it stands up in the charging stand, taking up much less room on the table where it sits. Also added a textured back to make it easier to grip. They got rid of the superfluous buttons that cluttered up the old One, but also removed some pretty useful ones. These buttons are now accessed through layers of a touch screen. Sometimes this works out well, and sometimes not. Really depends on your equipment and the type of controlling you need to do. For me, I still keep the original remotes close enough that I can use them to do the more intricate things I don't want to bother setting up and troubleshooting on the Harmony. Yes, troubleshoot. Not everything works right the first time.Some inconveniences: Ever hand your remote to someone so they can control things Well, be careful with the Ultimate. About 1/4 times one of us will accidentally activate something on the touchscreen during transfer from one hand to the other, and we're being careful. Also, for some reason they put the playback buttons (play, FF, REW, etc) above the touchscreen. Try using those without activating something on the touchscreen!Set up: Since I already had a Harmony One that was fine-tuned to my system (which took months to finesse!!!), set up was just a matter of transferring the information from the One to the Ultimate. Easy-cheesy. I don't look forward to learning how to set up the Ultimate for a new piece of equipment after seeing that the software is still the same: lame. For now, the Ultimate controls most things fine with no fuss on my part.If you want to get rid of all of your remotes the Ultimate One could be your solution. For me it wasn't. If you want the convenience of controlling most of the common functions of a lot of equipment and don't mind the limitations, then this expensive remote could be a great addition to your collection. We now have nine remotes instead of the seven that came with the equipment. The old One is still on the charger for my wife's use (she doesn't care for the lack of buttons on the Ultimate). The Ultimate is for me, most of the time. The individual equipment remotes are stashed close-by in case I need to access something I can't find on the Ultimate.If Logitech would update their software to the 21st century (they still have Laserdisc but don't have a proper category for ROKU) and put the touch screen at the top with all of the buttons grouped together, I'd love the Ultimate One. If they don't make changes to the software I won't buy a new One when this One wears out. There Can Be Only One! OK, I stole the review title from the infamous Highlander movie, but I did so because it does apply. The Harmony One, in world of universal remotes, really is the one remote that can replace all of your device remotes, but does so at a seemingly steep price, and with a small investment of time unless you are upgrading from another Logitech remote and your devices are already input into your online Logitech profile.This is my third Logitech remote - I am upgrading from an older model, the 650. The programming software I was using to update my 650 is no longer used by Logitech, nor does it even recognize the Ultimate One. So, despite logging in and repeatedly clicking upgrade remote, the remote could not connect to the Logitech website. I wasted two nights and about two hours trying to solve this problem and finally learned via Google that the One is not compatible with the old software. It would have been nice if this had been noted somewhere on the instructions.I was less than thrilled when I learned I would need to create a new profile and user name rather than simply logging in at the Logitech website with my existing information. Once I did, thankfully it asked if I had an existing account and once I entered my old information, it allowed me to port over all my existing devices. So, I got to where I needed to be but it took longer than it should have.Those of you who have Logitech remotes know that you enter your devices (TV model, DVD player, Home Theater Receiver model, etc) and then the software allows you to set up activities like watching a movie, playing a game. etc., and the software prompts you with questions about which device controls what function. (e.g., which device controls sound and volume, etc.) Once this is all programmed, you update the remote (which is connected to your computer) and off you go. Once this data is entered and configured, the One really shines. It lights up when you pick it up. You can control all your devices of course with 40, Works great My mother didn't necessarily need a louder ringer but rather a lower pitch. This worked wonderfully and I would recommend it. Loud enough for old folks I looked at a lot of options for a loud ringer and found this one. It does the job. It will keep me from missing calls. Most modern phones have soft rings that cannot be heard over TV and other background noise when the phone is in another room. Good buy.

42," Doing their Job I purchased 3 of these to use in. Qnap nas. I chose WD red due to their reputation of reliability. I have had a few WD red drive in other devices and they have all held up without issues.So far so good on all 3 drives. I trust my content living on these drives. Good for the price 2 TB for the price of $84.99 It was a great deal during this time but price might have went up. 2 TB is decent amount of space. If you do a lot of video editing and Fraps recording, I would suggest you get a bigger space, I'd say a 4TB. Unit works great so far. I have purchased 7 of these between two Lenovo Ts440 Servers, one is for a replacement. So far they have all been performing just fine. I have had no issues and I would recommend these drives, Western Digital does have a new version out now. Using these in QNAP NAS I ordered 8 of these drives for some QNAP NASes and did not have any problems out of them. They are definitely better quality than the Green and Blue WD drives. Great product! Great Price! Was pleasantly surprised to find that Best Buy's sale price on the hard drive was lower than many popular computer hardware retailers. These hard drives are great for a DIY home NAS build. Speedy Seems like fast access and if like my other WD Red drives, it should be reliable. Nothing but positive at this point! Good Drive Drive works well but it is NOT designed to be a desktop hard drive this drive is designed for NAS boxes. It will work in a desktop drive but windows may report errors due to the way the HDD is designed. Great for my NAS I have a bunch of these in two NAS units. They have never let me down.

43," Nice and Fast! Internet speed good from basement. Kind of big but does the job. Great product This is one of the best wireless adapters I’ve ever used. Awesome adapter I've had this adapter for about 2 months and I am amazed at just how fast it is. My speed test are over 100mbs every time I run one. Awesome!!!! Excellent device- easy to set up Love it. Speed is very good. Price is fair and it does the job. Super easy to hook up this was very easy to hook up to my computer. I am very happy with the purchase Works better then I thought! I have an old dell tower computer. So I thought with a newer item like this it would take some time to install but I was wrong it’s pretty much plug and play. Seems to work better then my other wireless devices as far as internet speed. Great signal improvement My router is located on opposite side of the house and with plaster walls signal quality was poor when using the laptops embedded Wi-Fi MIC. Purchased this in hopes of obtaining better signal quality and it was a great improvement Great adapter I was hesitant because I thought this couldn't compare to a PCI Express analog, but I'm relieved that it performs great. Awesome wifi usb adapter I have an older computer, and could not connect to 5g. with this I can Great speed and range Had really good speed, didnt have interruptions at all. Easy to use Probably the easiest component to set up on my computer and not hard to install. Big Help The wifi on my laptop went kaputt. Buying this prevented me from purchasing a new computer. Did what it was supposed to. The unit was a little bulky. I did not experience the advertised bust in productivity. Installation was quick and easy. Fastest Adapter Yet My old USB adapter was the Netgear A6210 and I thought connecting at 833MB/s was fast. With the A7000, I now connect at 1.3GB/s (1300MB/s). Amazing Upgrade from Almost Anything I have an extremely high-end motherboard with built-in AC WiFi in a custom-built. Typically going from N to AC is enough for most people. But using this Nighthawk A7000/AC1900 boosted my download speeds more than 5x. Cannot suggest this enough for anyone. Great product Device works perfectly just plug and play. Item is a little bulky. Impressed My son bought this for a computer he was building. We were amazed by how this adapter increased his signal. Would definitely recommend it. Get it for dank internet speeds Some people can't wire a long Ethernet cord around the house and this is a good replacement. Just make sure your router and your internet speed works with it. Excellent covg, easy install I use this with my Nighthawk router and the coverage is excellent. 5 bars by the pool 100' away. Highly recommend. Very Fast and Easy to Setup So far after a little bit of time using this wireless adapter it seems the be the best one I have found to date. Its super easy and quick to setup (drivers found on website for those without DVD drive) and provides a secure, very fast connection. The magnetic stand that come with is very useful and the magnet is strong so it wont move around. Nighthawk is some of the best products I've seen and definitely recommend to everyone.

45," Three Stars Do what it's supposed to do. Reaction time of the remote control can be faster. Programming via the computer was an arduous and timely process ... Programming via the computer was an arduous and timely process, there was significant lag between clicking and the program registering the input. Don't know about you, but we need this! I have had a logitech harmony remote for about 10 years and wouldn't want to have to deal without one. One touch turns on the TV and my Sony sound system/dvd player and the it is ready to watch tv by controlling my Tivo and volume etc. This new one has updated features like a touch screen and it is taking some time for me to get used to. It functions differently than my previous model but is much more flexible and can do much more with less programming. I think this one might be easier (less techy) to set up because now you don't have to do so much of your own programming, but instead you have to learn how to use the devices feature. But in the end, we watch a samsung tv, change the channels on a Tivo and control surround sound from our Sony home theater and if we chose to, we can record a program on our Toshiba DVD burner using nothing but this one Logitech programmable remote. Five Stars gave as a gift Five Stars Good Maybe mine is a dud First let me say I bought my Harmony Ultimate One from Dell, not Amazon. I had been using a harmony remote with fewer functions and really liked it.But I've had so much trouble with this one. This remote has a feature that you press if the remote didn't carry out all the steps you asked it to perform. For instance, if you want to watch roku, the remote is supposed to turn on the television and sound bar and change the television HDMI to the one that Roku is on. I'd say 6 out of 10 times, I've had to ask Harmony to fix it. Eventually, it does fix it, but as often as not, it takes several attempts. About 50 of the time, the off button doesn't work. And finally, there's not much life to the battery.....and that's been true from the get-go. I really wish I hadn't bought this thing! The most infuriating remote I've ever used. The button ... The most infuriating remote I've ever used. The button layout is an ergonomic nightmare. The weight distribution is so uneven, it falls constantly - off a table, off an armchair, out of your hand. The back is so over contoured and slick that you have to place it face down to stay on anything but a completely flat surface, but then you risk triggering the absurdly sensitive touch screen. Oh, the touch screen!!!! Be careful not to breathe on the damn thing or you'll be restarting your system or changing functions constantly and without warning. Did I mention that the battery life is godawful and you must charge it - no removable battery option. Avoid at all costs. Bought the Harmony 700 at Best Buy its working great Four weeks of frustration trying to set it up. Customer service is only via email and most of their solutions were generic. Gave up returned it.

I mean, wait until I change something, then update.That said, I have to fall back on my device remotes everyday because this device is little more that an on switch.I wish I had saved my money.

Not happy with this item it doesn't work as well as my old one. I have problems with the touchscreen This ruins the Harmony product line for me. Of all the Harmony remotes that I've owned over the years, this is by far my least favorite.Weaknesses:Lack of physical number buttons (This is of course a design choice by Harmony. I just don't like it)Lack of IR spread - This remote must be pointed directly at the devices you're trying to controlSlowness - Takes a long time to turn all the devices on. This used to be a configurable setting in the old software.Software usability - Compared to the old harmony software, the new version is watered down regarding functionality and lacks usability / intuitiveness.Operational issues - I have to hard reset this thing once a week or so because the screen stops turning offStrengths:Controls all my IR devicesPrice was good as I got it on saleI'll look elsewhere when it comes time to replace this.Harmony remotes I've owned in the past for various family members / locations. Of all of these, this is the worst:Harmony 1 - The best by farHarmony Touch - Very similar to the Ultimate in feel but works way better.Harmony 700 - Solid and affordableHarmony 880 - Great remote until the dog got itThere's another silver version that I haven't had to mess with in so long I even forget the model . Excellent product! I am not tech savvy at all ... Excellent product! I am not tech savvy at all and this is so easy to use. I LOVE IT!!! Not worth it Found myself not really using this anymore. Touch screen is a nice idea, but I've found that I prefer just remembering where the buttons are so I don't have to look at my remote so often to see what I'm pushing. Great Remote Once you get the hang of it, it's amazing! I love this remote I love this remote. It synced with my TV, cable box and sonos sound bar. I can now control all my devices with one remote. It also allows me to use my smart tv functions like Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu. Great remote! Pays for itself In battery savings alone this remote pays for itself. Just look around your house and you will see how much battery dependency you have alreeady Almost there I got this through the vine program.We already have the Ultimate + hub for our living room. So I got this for our bedroom setup.Set up. Amazingly easy and the Logitech database of electronics they can support is extensive and even had my old Westinghouse monitor. Updating the firmware is painless too.Use. This is where Logitech comes up a little short thus the 4 stars. The touch screen is either too sensitive or not sensitive enough. Sometimes when I swipe or click a button it works and other times it doesn't. I really don't know what I am doing wrong. But the touch screen and the several pages (swipe left/right) really makes things convenient.Also provides the 30 second fast forward for my Comcast DVR and 15 second jump back.An incredibly impressive piece of hardware. Battery life is great. And firmware updates come fast and regularly. Get it. You won't be disappointed! WOW! What a great remote.I bought a new Samsung Soundbar that for whatever reason Samsung didn't design it to turn on AND off with the TV. It was one or the other depending on how you connected it (Optical or HDMI). I spoke with a co-worker who raved about this remote and thought that it might work. I gave it a try and to my amazement, it worked!Not only that, but it also easily controls all of my devices.Would highly recommend. Five Stars Works great. Love it. Buy it now to get rid of multiple remotes! Second remote and it's as great as the first with the hub. Cannot go wrong with this for all your entertainment needs in any room. This one is in our living room but it works just as well as the original with hub in our bedroom. Five Stars It is the best product. I am really satisfied. Very useful but needs a headphone jack This is a preliminary review after a week or so of use. I have now retired five remotes including my previous Logitech Harmony 510. The remote has a nice feel and is easy to operate. Occasionally, it skips. By that I mean, when I choose one thing, I get another, but infrequently and it is not a major problem.It takes a while to find something but I am sure this will improve with use. The learning curve is probably more steep than with the 510 and I'm still searching for things however, the menu layout is reasonably logical so that is a help. One thing I miss from my 510 is the ability to skip forward 30 seconds or backwards 10 seconds when watching a recording. That is an extremely useful tool that should be incorporated in the next model...or did I miss itAnother thing I really wish could be incorporated into remotes, including this one, is the feature on the Roku remote: a headset plugin capability. This is extremely useful since it eliminates long cords. Perhaps future models.Overall, I am quite (not yet very) happy with the HUO remote and expect to continue using it for a number of years. Not recommended We have always bought Harmony remotes and Were very happy with them. However, this remote is a Big disappointment. Not easy to Set up. Not easy to use at all. To much screen swiping to get to the function you want. Screen is too sensitive. Buttons are small and easy to mistress. Not happy with his purchase. I do not recommend. Dissappointed I downloaded the Harmony software. I setup the tv and cable box then hit the sync button. It didn't sync. I tried on another computer. Same thing. I called support and followed their instructions. Same problem. Called tech once more. Same instructions. Tried once more. Same problem. Disappointed. I have a Harmony 6 years old and have never had a problem. I returned the Ultimate. Piece of junk!! This is an update from a previous review. I have had this remote for about a year now and it is absolute garbage. There is not one single time that it operates as programed and I don't have to use the help button to finish the programmed function. The remote has been programmed multiple times and all of the functions work but not with the push of one button like it's supposed to, you always have to use help. This remote is a complete let down and a waste of 250. Do not waste your money. Good Products, When attempting to get a refund for ... Good Products, When attempting to get a refund for the difference on a sale it was a hassle and did not work out but I am super happy with the device. Easy to program and custom setting Easy to program and custom setting. (also work with Android TV box)Cons: Can't have different list of favorite channels. (Direct TV, TV antenna). Harmony 700 can do. Works great for me I never thought I could get excited over a remote control, but I did with this one. First of all, let me state that I was on the fence after reading the reviews here on Amazon, but I took the plunge and so far I'm not regretting it. This is my first Harmony remote, so I obviously can't make comparisons with previous models which might have been better than the unit presently under review.It took me 30 to 45 minutes to set up and sync my new remote through the Harmony software. That was a breeze, but it's important that you know your system and how its individual components are connected to each other. All my components were supported by the remote, so no problems there. I was able to customize the background image on the touchscreen. A nice touch, though not very important.Once the first sync from software to remote is completed, the remote will work on your system. As opposed to the previous situation, where you had four remotes lying around, you will now hit one button ('activity') and your TV, AV receiver and third component will turn on all at once. Great! At first this does not work flawlessly. For instance, you hit 'Watch TV' and everything might come on, but the AV receiver won't be on the right channel. The great thing about this remote, though, is that it learns on the job: It will ask you if the function performed as desired, and if not, how it can improve. After my initial use with every component, these flaws were pretty much ironed out. I now have a perfect remote with no issues whatsoever.One downside to all this automation is that the Harmony cannot predict when you've been fooling around with your equipment behind its back. Turned off your TV by hand using that device's own power button The Harmony doesn't know, so when you switch everything off through the remote (again: just ONE button), your TV will come back on again. You can work around this by customizing the color buttons on the bottom of the remote to be separate power on/off buttons for the individual components. You'll need to customize these buttons for every programmed activity, so there's an initial time investment involved. And of course there are no markings for these functions on the remote, so you'll have to memorize everything. All in all this is not ideal.If you want to nitpick, a few other minor cons are: 1) the sluggish touchscreen and 2) slightly flimsy buttons. This is nothing I can get worked up about.None of the downsides mentioned above can put a damper on my excitement. I'm very happy with this product. I'm still a tiny bit worried about the negative reviews and, subsequently, the longevity of this remote. Time will tell, and I'll adjust my rating if this thing fails within the first year or so. So far I'd highly recommend it. Great product! Definitely disappointed This is my second Logitech Harmony remote. I had my first one for eight years and loved it.I HATE this remote!!!Yes hate.Honestly, I don't even think it should be in the same category as my old Harmony remote. This version is a significant downgrade. The buttons have far less customization, the our old remote. The layout of the buttons on the remote lack a comfortable feel and placement. The removal of the number buttons in favor of the touch screen might not seem like a big deal. But instead of being about to press in 300 for your favorite channel you now need to: Touch the Screen Swipe to unlock If it doesn't come up to the number screen you have to flip through the screens to find the numbers Then enter the 300Who at Logitech thought doubling the number of keystrokes needed made any sense at all I certainly don't!I will say, this remote does eliminate the need for multiple remotes. But the downsides of this remote really don't make me happy about the amount of money that it cost. Now everything is fine, as long as I make sure to keep ... Took some time to set everything up. It had some problems with my TV (somehow skipping some inputs when switching modes) but that started working at some point (not sure what exactly I changed). Now everything is fine, as long as I make sure to keep pointing the remote to the devices while it is doing 'its thing' which takes longer than normal remotes. Five Stars Works great and easy to set up It was easy to hook up to our 4 different units We've been using it for about a month now and no complaints. It was easy to hook up to our 4 different units, also it has a learn feature so if there is something that's not working right you can customize it and make it work better. It is not getting better all the time. I purchased this to replace my Harmony one, which I loved. This remote was more expensive and vastly inferior. The ergonomics are terrible. The remote cannot be operated effectively with one hand. To reach the hard buttons at the top, one invariably activates the touch screen by mistake. In general, there are too few hard buttons (like HELP) requiring you to look down at the touch screen unnecessarily. In addition, the touch screen is not sensitive enough and frequently does not recognize taps. The swipe feature (which is nice in theory) is also not sensitive and often requires do-overs. After 4 months of babying (i.e., not letting the kids use it), the top half of the touch screen no longer worked at all. Subsequently found out that free technical support in the US is only available for 90 days (unlike Europe and Asia, which have 2 years and 1 year free phone support respectively). Without technical support, I was close to returning this, but with a little self-help persistence on the website, I was able to figure out how to reboot it (which solved the problem). Still, it should not have to be this difficult. Charging for technical support during the warranty period is a poor business model. Hope this company gets its act back together. Fantastic product - wish I had sprung for this sooner! Brilliant product. I have a somewhat more advanced home entertainment setup with a AV receiver, Roku, DVD, and fairly new Motorola DVR from FiOS and this configured and handled them all perfectly - the first time I set it up.The genius of the product is that it's programmed online and Logitech has thousands of components already identified - and they allow you to check in advance if your devices are directly supported with a look-up utility on their site. I wasn't sure about my Pioneer VSX-33TX THX receiver as it's probably 10 years old, but it was no problem. You connect the remote to your computer, Windows 7 found the drivers online without issue, then go to the Logitech setup site and create an account if you don't already have one. Then you type in the model numbers of everything that you have. If your setup is simple that may be all you need to do, but they take care of multiple 'keypress' needs very elegantly. For example, to play a DVD I have to change the plasma display to HDMI 2, set the AV receiver to DVD input, then turn on the DVD. Logitech's setup anticipated the devices and the inputs that I'd probably be using so all I needed to do was to confirm and save. Then a single touch to the onscreen display on the Harmony does it all.Be aware that like most IR remotes, it wants a pretty straight line-of-site to the components and any glass in between will weaken the signal. My components are all in a cabinet with glass doors about 12 feet from our seating area and remote control wasn't a problem although it was necessary to be pointing fairly directly at the cabinet. If you're not sure about distances or want to be lazy when aiming, pick up and install an IR repeater and it will solve that problem.Honestly, I have nothing negative to say about this device. The ergonomics and setup are inspired and so human friendly that even my wife was impressed. The 200 seems expensive initially but if you consider programming a typical button-only remote can take hours and I had this set up in 15 minutes, it quickly seems like money well spent. If you are a tech junkie like me you will love this remote. This is a great product once you get it all set up. The set up process is a bit time consuming but once it is up and running it works great. If you are a tech junkie like me you will love this remote. Maybe, Maybe Not But Logitech Stands Behind Their Product To preface my review, I am not a technophobe and have programmed other Harmony remotes.After hours of programming and re-reprogramming the remote it still does not operate properly. When I think I have the problem solved the remote fails to perform a basic function like turning on or off my devices. Based on my experience this remote is not as easy as 1-2-3-4 to set up. This is a shame because the remote has some really nice features but all the great features in the world are of no value if the remote doesn't perform basic functions.You might wonder why not call customer service. I did and here is my experience. The bright spot about contacting customer service was that I was able to reach someone without waiting an hour to speak with someone. Also I called at 4:30 pm a half-hour before the service center closes and the customer serve rep worked with me past closing time. Bottom line was the customer service rep attempted to help me and went as far as remotely changing settings on the remote on-line which only made the problem worse. At one point I had to take a quick call and explained that I would put the rep on hold and be right back. As soon as I put the call on hold the rep hung up. No call back in case it was an accidental disconnect. I called back only to find the service center was closed. I was left standing there with my remote in my hand. A remote that did not operate. I was able to re-program the remote so it could operate albeit not properly.I can't recommend this product and urge you not to purchase this product. Clearly the product does not work as advertised and their customer service is pathetic. I will contact customer no-service this week when i have the time and update this review. But in the meantime don't waste your time or money on this remote.Update -We'll it has been almost a week since I wrote my review. Just to be clear none of my components or TV are concealed and well within range. Someone from Logitech contacted me via email (no phone). Unfortunately I am extremely busy during the week and could not speak to Ian Crowe although I did call Logitech in California and left a voice mail for Ian this afternoon. I tried to work with Logitech's customer no-service today. I spoke to someone off-shore somewhere. No help. In fact he tried to tell me my remote was an RF remote. Just to make sure this tech rep was wrong I called Vizio to ensure the remote was an IR remote. It is. Sadly I am still where I was last week. Sending me an email offering to help me is great but I need solutions not empty offers to help. Ian please call me.2nd Update - I have been working with Logitech's Senior Manager for Customer Service in the Bay Area, for the past two Fridays. It looks like the problem has been solved (crossing my fingers). I really appreciate the time and effort that Ian has made to make things right. Logitech is sending an optional hub to try in case the current fix does not work. If I have to return the remote Ian has promised a refund even if I return the remote after 30 days. I hope I don't have to use the hub or return the remote. If I have to return the remote it is not because of Logitech's not trying. I really believe that Ian has gone above and beyond what would be expected.The Bottom Line: This remote might be buggy depending on your AV equipment. But when it works, it works great. So far I really like using the remote. I especially like the favorites screen. I think my tech challenged wife will be able to use the remote too. Logitech has stepped up and helped make a bad situation a good one. I would recommend Logitech to a friend or family member. I changed the title of my review and gave the remote 3 stars from 1 star. Give this a product a shot understanding there could be a problem but Logitech will work with you to make it right. I hope the current fix works and I won't have to return the remote it really is great to use. Great produce Easy to setup, work great. Rate AAA+ Awful design, terrible programming app, poor compatibility Terrible product, if you have ever tried the original Harmony One. Starting with the MyHarmony Windows app (or the browser equivalent myharmony.com) that offer a lot less programmability than the old Harmony Remote Software. Importing existing settings from previous remotes is far from accurate. The Ultimate One was unable to control a Pioneer Elite TV, a Linksys DMA 2200 media center extender, and to understand that I have my media center PC always on. Marred by several device incompatibility and by awful, awful design: how practical is it to have the Play/Pause Skip/Back buttons on top To use the playback controls means pushing buttons at the tip of the remote, so it is not firmly in your hand. Therefore, no one-hand wielding and thumb controls: you need one hand to hold the remote steady and the other to push buttons. The ffwd/skipfwd button combo is not good, despite the haptic feedback, as the extended press is a waste of time and not very accurate because of lag. The touchscreen menus are confusing, bare and unappealing. The scrolling system not very sensitive. I do not want to have to swipe the touchscreen every time I want to access some info or programmed function. It's just another annoying step. There are a hundred more negative things I could say about it. I strongly disliked it, despite being a fan of the half dozen other Harmony remotes that I have programmed over nearly ten years. Not their best effort.... The technology freezes and loops. It also fails toporperly set or turn off single devices in sets. This causes you to have to do troubleshooting and a manual fix. Ready to Purchase I looked at this remote 2 days ago and decided to try the Harmony 650 first to confirm that Logitech's infra red system would with our equipment and because it does I came back to purchase one of these too however, the price jumped by nearly 40.00.Lower the price and I am a customer of this remote too FWIW, the Harmony 650 works flawlessly.Thank you Five Stars Easy to use, great replacement for our old model. Competent but for the premium price lacking premium functionality Okay, semi expert here. This is my fourth Harmony universal remote in about ten years. Perhaps that leads to conclusions about issues of longevity I'm a little torn on that. Yes, they do get daily work, but a little more in the build quality, especially for the steep price, seems warranted. Battery life on the previous models was also not good - I am talking about rechargeable models.Sadly, nobody makes as usable as a remote as Logitech/Harmony. If I am wrong please tell me in the comments - I am willing to switch!While easy to use, easy to set up is not the same thing. If you are tech savvy, it is not too difficult and the biggest challenge is first, getting all your correct model numbers for all your gear, second, knowing enough about how you have all this set up in terms of both audio and video inputs and outputs. Advice, write it down and keep it on file. That is a fair amount of work and takes some knowledge. Unlike my last model, the default button setup for this and my different devices was a bit off. I had to customize button settings for my cable box (FIOS) to properly use the Favorites guide and a few other things including On Demand - that's right, no default button set up for On Demand. In actual use my wife was able to start using it right away, but there are some quibbles here and there on having this be the only remote we need. Back to cable, but some often used functions, like search, are more cumbersome with this than the FIOS remote. We can live with it and let that stay in a drawer, but again, for 250 I think we can all demand a bit more thoughtfulness and user testing. Not to be AV elitist, but I don't think your average person with an average set up is going to shell out 250 for a remote. We want ease of use, but also versatility. FYI, I am running this with a HD TV, audio video receiver and a 5.1 surround setup, FIOS cable box, Roku 4, blueray DVD player and (for old family stuff I am working to convert) an actual VHS VCR!P.S. Swipe gesture thing is a gimmick and not very useful - volume buttons are easier to use. Would have much rather had the effort of this go into lower cost or functionality. Form factor/ergonomics is not the best either. Volume, channel, guide - highly used buttons not in a natural position for the hand. Hire a real Human Factors person please! Five Stars Great product, great price. Great Investment! Probably one of the best investments I could have gotten. Glad it can control my WD TV. The first time I've use only one remote in a long time. Great idea poor engineering Like most people I hate having seven remotes to control my system so combining them into one unit is a great idea. I appreciate the opportunity to review the Ultimate One and compare it to my two-year-old One with the failing buttons. Although the Ultimate One is pretty smart and quite functional in many ways, Logitech misses the mark for me on several important points.Software: Try finding Roku for the Harmony. There are several classifications to look under but none of them make sense for Roku. It's listed under DVD. Go figure. Try Apple TV. Good luck with that one. Brand new hardware (Ultimate One) with the same old crappy software. If they spent a couple of days with a new software team leader in charge, maybe they'd come up with a better system, but this one has irritated me since I bought the old One more than two years ago.Hardware: Improved the shape and size over the old One so that now it stands up in the charging stand, taking up much less room on the table where it sits. Also added a textured back to make it easier to grip. They got rid of the superfluous buttons that cluttered up the old One, but also removed some pretty useful ones. These buttons are now accessed through layers of a touch screen. Sometimes this works out well, and sometimes not. Really depends on your equipment and the type of controlling you need to do. For me, I still keep the original remotes close enough that I can use them to do the more intricate things I don't want to bother setting up and troubleshooting on the Harmony. Yes, troubleshoot. Not everything works right the first time.Some inconveniences: Ever hand your remote to someone so they can control things Well, be careful with the Ultimate. About 1/4 times one of us will accidentally activate something on the touchscreen during transfer from one hand to the other, and we're being careful. Also, for some reason they put the playback buttons (play, FF, REW, etc) above the touchscreen. Try using those without activating something on the touchscreen!Set up: Since I already had a Harmony One that was fine-tuned to my system (which took months to finesse!!!), set up was just a matter of transferring the information from the One to the Ultimate. Easy-cheesy. I don't look forward to learning how to set up the Ultimate for a new piece of equipment after seeing that the software is still the same: lame. For now, the Ultimate controls most things fine with no fuss on my part.If you want to get rid of all of your remotes the Ultimate One could be your solution. For me it wasn't. If you want the convenience of controlling most of the common functions of a lot of equipment and don't mind the limitations, then this expensive remote could be a great addition to your collection. We now have nine remotes instead of the seven that came with the equipment. The old One is still on the charger for my wife's use (she doesn't care for the lack of buttons on the Ultimate). The Ultimate is for me, most of the time. The individual equipment remotes are stashed close-by in case I need to access something I can't find on the Ultimate.If Logitech would update their software to the 21st century (they still have Laserdisc but don't have a proper category for ROKU) and put the touch screen at the top with all of the buttons grouped together, I'd love the Ultimate One. If they don't make changes to the software I won't buy a new One when this One wears out. There Can Be Only One! OK, I stole the review title from the infamous Highlander movie, but I did so because it does apply. The Harmony One, in world of universal remotes, really is the one remote that can replace all of your device remotes, but does so at a seemingly steep price, and with a small investment of time unless you are upgrading from another Logitech remote and your devices are already input into your online Logitech profile.This is my third Logitech remote - I am upgrading from an older model, the 650. The programming software I was using to update my 650 is no longer used by Logitech, nor does it even recognize the Ultimate One. So, despite logging in and repeatedly clicking upgrade remote, the remote could not connect to the Logitech website. I wasted two nights and about two hours trying to solve this problem and finally learned via Google that the One is not compatible with the old software. It would have been nice if this had been noted somewhere on the instructions.I was less than thrilled when I learned I would need to create a new profile and user name rather than simply logging in at the Logitech website with my existing information. Once I did, thankfully it asked if I had an existing account and once I entered my old information, it allowed me to port over all my existing devices. So, I got to where I needed to be but it took longer than it should have.Those of you who have Logitech remotes know that you enter your devices (TV model, DVD player, Home Theater Receiver model, etc) and then the software allows you to set up activities like watching a movie, playing a game. etc., and the software prompts you with questions about which device controls what function. (e.g., which device controls sound and volume, etc.) Once this is all programmed, you update the remote (which is connected to your computer) and off you go. Once this data is entered and configured, the One really shines. It lights up when you pick it up. You can control all your devices of course with just the one remote. You can even stagger power on or off order if you want. It will set your TV and other devices to the correct inputs if they need to be changed between functions.I use an Xbox One to watch my Blu Rays and DVD's. The Xbox controller is a poor TV remote. We like subtitles on when we watch DVD's. I was able to set up a quick one button macro in the Logitech software that walks through the four button presses required on the Xbox One to enable subtitles with a single button press on the Ultimate One. The software allows a high degree of customization that I really appreciate.Of course, this programming ability is part of what drives the high cost of the product. This isn't just a remote. It is really a software driven input device with a touch screen. (I use a combination of the touch screen and my buttons depending on my mood). It lights up when you pick it up, feels good in your hands, and in a feature I really like - it has its own charging cradle. Past versions really ate up batteries. I like returning it to its charging cradle after use because I know where it is when I need it again, and it saves me the cost of replacing batteries.As others have noted, not everyone would consider spending 250 on a remote. Even if you are willing to spend the money, you still need some basic technological prowess to program and fine tune this remote to make it work for you. If you have relatives that still struggle with basic computer tasks or how to program their DVR to record their favorite shows, this is not a product for them. I have family members who could not ever hope to program this remote. It is not a complex task to do so, but for people who struggle with technology, programming this remote could be a formidable task.I have a fairly simple home theater line-up with no line of sight issues, so I can't address using this with a hub. But, if you are sick of juggling remotes on movie night, or want to upgrade an existing Logitech, the One is a great step forward. Avoid like the plague! I would give zero stars if I could. This remote promises great things, but fails miserably to deliver. I purchased two of these remotes, and had to return both of them because neither of them would sync with my computer. I have been a dedicated Harmony user for the past four years (see my glowing review of the Harmony 1100) and have NEVER had so much difficulty setting up a universal remote. The sync would hang without finishing, or wouldn't start up at all, and the setup failed to recognize a couple of my devices even though I was absolutely certain I had entered the correct model numbers. I am considerably tech-savvy, and could understand if this problem had occurred with only one remote... but BOTH!! Never again. Wife hates it!!! Very disappointing. Lists the ability to turn components on. I constantly have to reinstall programing. Family Hates it! Five Stars best remote like it a lot better then the remote that came with the tv Have had several Harmony Remotes. This one is terrible. Everyone in my family hates this new harmony remote. We love our Harmony One up in the kids playroom but the Ultimate is the ultimate disappointment. It is not well balanced in hand. It defaults to screens we don't want on the touch screen. It requires 2 hands since it is so out of balance that touching some of the buttons feels really wonky. Do not buy one of these. A used or refurbed Harmony One would be much better. I think the guys who designed this were too in love with their Android phones and wanted to create a similar feel but it stinks. I fail to find a way to make it start on the screen we want. I've actually had to threaten my kids with punishment if they bring up how much they hate this one. Easy to program Pro: Does it all. Easy to program.Con: Extremely, Highly sensitive touch screen. Shorter battery life than expected, but that may increase over time. No service after the warranty expires Be aware that there is no service on any Harmony unit after the warranty expires. Heres a quote from the answer to my request for service.Unfortunately, Logitech does not offer repair services for out of warranty products, including Harmony remotes, nor can I recommend any repair shops that work on our products.Ian CroweDirector, Customer ExperienceLogitech Harmony Remotes Four Stars SOMEWHAT CLUMSY TO USE Works great Got this to replace an older harmony and it works great. It was very easy to set up since it just took the configuration of my old harmony and used that for the new one. Very Nice Remote that does its job ... almost all the time. Performs as expected ... the vast majority of the time. Sometimes it seems to lose its programing as to a particular function. I don't know if I accidentally hit a wrong button first that threw it off or it just failed. Luckily, each time it failed, I have gone in the drop down menu and selected Fix It which presents a menu of devices. You then select the device that failed and you are provided with various possibilities as to the failure. Let's say you hit the off button and your receiver failed to shut off. You just select your receiver which is automatically listed under Fix It and then select the Power Off button. Each time the receiver shut off and was thereafter fixed until the next mishap which is acceptabely rare. Another consumer caused problem can be that when you hit off you did not aim your remote in the direction of the receiver long enough. So my Ultra High Def Vizio will shut off but my Onkyo receiver may remain on. The macro involved with all combined functions sends separate signals out to each device that had been needed for the function button that was previously used, e.g. Watch TV, Watch Smart Devices, Watch Blue Ray, Listen to FM. In any case, it allows me to keep all my other remotes in a convenient location, in case there is a failure that might require one of them, but the Harmony is the sole remote on my bed. Nice. The best controller I have ever used seen or heard of. Fantastic - it is programmable with a computer MAC or PC. Like how it recognizes all the components - TV, Cable, sound bar, Blu-Ray player. Apple TV. Read the reviews and and made the jump to get this and really glad I did. Lives up to all the platitudes previously rendered. worth the switch from the 1100 had 2 Harmony 1100's (spilt wine on the first), liked them but found fast forwarding a pain, especially when having to time pressing play at the end of adverts, also the display output would keep flipping upside down. Ultimate One fixes that plus several other nice touches. Some complain about the fast forward being at top of remote, I see the point but doesn't bother me enough. hopefully Logitech will continue to invest in their remotes. awesome set up can be a little difficult but you ... Formerly 6 remotes ...now one .... awesomeset up can be a little difficult but you get used to it and fine tune to your liking pretty quickly.shape is a little funny kind of wants to slide out of your hand with all the weight at the bottom and tapered towards the top.whatever, i like it mainly because i cant stand digging through a pile of remotes I have owned a Harmony One for many years and absolutely LOVE it. I did not like the Ultimate One ... Not very functional. I have owned a Harmony One for many years and absolutely LOVE it. I did not like the Ultimate One AT ALL. I ended up paying extra for a new, discontinued Harmony One. On the Ultimate One there are very few hard buttons. Anytime you want to do anything you have to swipe / flip through the screens to get to the section you want then push the soft button. Also, it is too sensitive and you end up pushing something you didn't intend to. They do have a lock feature for the screen but THEN you have to unlock the screen THEN swipe / flip to the screen you need to find the function / feature you want. I'm begging Logitech to focus on making the Harmony One better... they really came up with a winner on that one. Great way to end remote clutter in your family room This product blows me away with how well it manages multiple devices simultaneously. Even my non-technical husband likes it! We were able to replace 5 remotes with this single controller and it operates everything really well. Especially nice is its ability to learn functions from other remotes that you can assign to the empty function buttons. Just remember to pop it into its charger once or twice a week. This gets the job done, but leaves me feeling disappointed. I've been using this remote for about a year now, before that had a harmony one (which I miss, but we finally sat on it too many times and it broke)The good:I can use it to control my Apple TV, Tivo HD, Bluray player and receiver with ease. All the needed buttons seem to be there for with some left over for extra stuff. I've got the 30 sec skip forward and back programmed on the bottom buttons, as well as the Live TV button and cancel button for Tivo.You can setup your favorite channels as icons on the fly and sync them back to your computer.The help feature always seems to work for me when things mess up. The Harmony one often took several steps to correct the power if the TV went to sleep.Recharging dock is nice.It actually replaces all my other remotes.The disappointing:I miss having a hard number buttons. The screen is a poor replacement. You have to swipe several times to get the to software keyboard.The screen doesn't wake up when you move the remove like the Harmony One did. The touchscreen is too slow and doesn't feel responsive compared to a smartphone.The gestures are completely useless for controls.You have to swipe several times to get the to software keyboard.The setup software was a pain in the ass to get going. It used silver lite or some plugin in a browser. It would have been better as a native app. The software menus were confusing and some features seems exclusive when they shouldn't have been. I couldn't program a tivo button and something else. I had to get the tivo remote and program it as a custom button.The button signals are also too slow. I was able to shorten them in the software program, but only for favorite channel buttons. Turning things off from my TV mode takes 15 seconds or so, doesn't sound like much but feels like forever pointing it at the screen.While I could change speed of the favorite buttons punching in the numbers, I couldn't get it fast enough. I think the min time between presses was 200ms or something. I feel like I can punch in the numbers faster on my Tivo remote, if I wanted too. I should be able to make this faster but I couldn't in the software.Overall, if you have the money, get the Harmony remote with the hardware buttons (it cost 2X what this one does). This gets the job done, but leaves me feeling disappointed. Four Stars Allows me to have all electronics in a closet and out of sight. This is the one that was the best for me I tried two other Harmony remotes first, the elite and the ultimate home. This is the one that was the best for me. but I can still say I am mostly happy with this remote I have had this remote for a couple years, but I can still say I am mostly happy with this remote! It is easy enough to program and use you can program special functions (like when you want to play a blueray, it automatically turns on the TV, Blueray player, and surround sound with a single button.There are a couple things that are a pain:-Frequent requests for you to update the remote (I usually ignore them)-The rechargeable battery life is just OK.I do love that I can use my phone since the remote works through your home network though! Horrible Replacement. Go with the Harmony One Logitech sent me this as a replacement due to a swollen battery issue in my Harmony One remote. I thought wow, what great customer service, they sent me a brand new remote with no questions asked. After using it a few times, it's easy to figure out why. 1st the good:-Small / Easy to grip-Easy to set up, especially favorite channelsNow the bad:-The layout is horrible. With buttons at both above and below the touch screen, navigation is very awkward.-There are no numeral buttons on the remote itself. You have to swipe through a few menus on the touchscreen to access them.- You cannot access the battery easily, if you need a replacement.Overall this is an okay remote, but for the price they charge, I would still try to find a Harmony One remote. This older model is easier to use than the Ultimate One. Hopefully Logitech will design a new model to replace this model. Four Stars Not very easy to use but does work on all my devices. Five Stars Like it Says....its Ultimate. excellent remote excellent remote Easy to program Works well and easy to program. I had a harmony 650 before for another room and this is for the theater room with 5 devices. Harmony Ultimate One.. Loved It!! As advertised!! Easy to use and setup on line. No problems with unit operation and quality. I loved the One I never write reviews, but I felt I had to for this remote. I was the owner of a Logitech Harmony One for several years prior to purchasing this remote. I loved the One, it was reliable, easy to use, and felt nice in the hand. I have been using the Ultimate One for well a year now, and for the price this remote falls short.First was the set up. Logitech switched to a new program, so if you were coming over from a previous device you had to start from scratch. I feel that everything should have simply imported to the new program. This added a good amount of time to the set up. The remote itself looks great, and is lightweight. However, it does not feel as ergonomic as the One did. It is also lacking the number buttons, which makes quickly switching between several channels more time consuming than a traditional remote. You have to either scroll through the channels or go through the touch screen to find the channel icon you want.When it comes to functionality the remote really falls short. I purchased the 100 hub to control my PS3. The remote constantly loses its pairing with the system. I am them forced to get the PS3 controller and re-register the blu tooth device all over again. It defeats the entire purpose of the remote. It is also not uncommon for the remote and HUB itself to lose their pairing. Forcing you to either restart the HUB or connect the remote to a computer and reset it.The remote also has not had the ability to connect to a PS4 until recently, and it still can not turn the system on/off. If I still need to go to the system or use my PS remote, what is the use of the universal remote The remote also seems to incorrectly perform the start up or shut down of a process more frequently than my One did. Making me either press the help button, go into the devices and fix it myself, or physically get up and turn a component on of off.I would have given my One five stars to give you an idea of the step back this remote is. For the 350 I paid when it was new (including the HUB), this is a real let down.***Update 4/29/16***Somehow this remote has become even less functional. As noted above there is no easy way to change the channel with this remote. The icons are now completely useless. For example if I want to change to channel 44.1 I press the icon button because I do not want to scroll through 20 channels, and the on screen numbers do not work well. The first press will get me 4.1. Next 1, then 4.1, then .1, then 44. Finally I'm at a channel that I can just scroll to. Sometimes it never even gets close and I will just scroll through all the channels. I make sure to keep the remote pointed directly at the TV, and give it time between button presses but nothing works. I am changing my review to one star. Five Stars Outstanding worth the price if you have a lot of equipment Four Stars Would be perfect if the number buttons on the screen were more responsive Aside from that this is a very nice remote. I wish the software was less wizard-y My second Harmony remote. I would prefer a real numeric keypad vs the on-screen one. Aside from that this is a very nice remote. I wish the software was less wizard-y. Had a hard time setting up the favorite channels. I bought a 650 for half the ... The set-up software was buggy. Had a hard time setting up the favorite channels. I bought a 650 for half the price that works just as well as my old Harmony One. Good but compared to older models, it is annoying This is my 3rd Harmony remote, I bought it because my last Harmony One had a broken display after using it for 4 years. Therefore my review is based on the comparison of the last 2 remotes I used.First thing I noticed is that this remote is lighter than the other ones. Also, in order to upload the configuration I needed to download the new MyHarmony software, instead the older software. The good thing is that I was able to migrate all the configuration from my Harmony One. However, after the migration, not all configuration was perfectly in place, for example, some of the buttons were not working, or not there anymore, so I needed to manually configure them again (not perfect).This remote is based on its touchscreen display, I am trying to get used to it, since my Harmony One had more 'analog' buttons. This one of the disavantages (I think): I was used to feel the buttons and never look at them when I needed to press anything. With this remote I need to look at the display every time I need to change channels. However you can include your favorite channels as your main screen, which makes sense since I noticed I usually watch a half dozen channels.If you are a newbie with a Harmony remote you may find some difficulties with programming, but since I have already owned a previous model, I think it is a very good remote, but a little worse than older models. Three Stars Its a little glitchy at times A Complete Waste of Time and Money This is the worst product I've ever bought. I have two different computers: one Windows, and the other a Mac. Both have the compatible operating systems with which to set up this remote. Unfortunately even after spending well over an hour with a Logitech support person I was unable to get into the set up page. on either computer. The Logitech web site is ambiguous and extremely un-user friendly. I'm good with computers and have never had an issue with any other device, but this one is simply poorly designed, with poor software, and even though the support person was trying, they simply had no clue either. Save your money, and buy a non Logitech universal remote, and will save the unbelievable headaches of this compete waste of money. Like it so far Like it so far. This is a replacement for my old Logitech 1100 that I had for years. Still getting use to it, but does everything that I need it to do. I find it hard to handle and use, the ... I find it hard to handle and use, the programmed channels never work with out trying 6 times, even when using the numbers screen you have to try sometimes 3 or 4 times before you get the channel you want. Great Features and programming, but difficult to manipulate. The ease of programming, setting up components and accessing them is super. However, Some often used functions are at the bottom of the remote and two hands are needed to press the buttons. Also we have experienced trying to hit one button and actually brush another resulting in the wrong selection. But we'll probably get used to doing it right. Great remote- but doesn't support Hubs. I bought this hoping to replace one that looks just like it but also supports communicating with the home control hub. Unfortunately, this one doesn't support that feature, only its own standalone IR features. While not a deal breaker for me, don't make the same mistake if you're looking to replace a dead remote that you use with the wifi home control hubs. Great all in one remote Was looking for a new family room remote to control tv,tivo,yamaha tuner, blueray player and apple tv all with the push of a single button.The Logitech - Harmony Ultimate One did all this and has room for more. Great Price I bought this remote based on a sale price, and I wanted to reduce the remotes cluttering my desk. It was easy to program but I am still learning how to use itMy cable provider was not provided in the Program List so I had to add my favorite channels manually and upload the icons myself . As a surprise bonus I was able to load a fun Icon. The Icon I chose for CNN is ""CNN FAKE News"" That alone was worth the price of the Remote Great Budget Harmony Remote Got this for my dad for his birthday, Hardest part is having to get all the model numbers of your electronics. Super useful and it's great to be able to recharge instead of replace batteries. Amazing universal remote Amazing works better than I expected, I was looking for something that would be simple when I needed simple and would work for all my devices. convenient but somewhat confusing this remote makes it convenient to have everything controlled with just the one remote - however, it's a little confusing but we are still getting used to it Awesome !! It was hard to figure out how to do all the program setup but once I figured it out and use one remote instead of 5 remote it's so much easier but sometime pain in the butt great remote... I love it Awesome remote. Easy to set up and use. It's very intuitive and customizable. Great sound system Great sound system… Would definitely recommend…... Works well, few physical buttons Bought this to replace a broken Harmony One remote. The new My Harmony application works better than the Harmony website. You can store multiple remotes in the application. Remote has fewer hard buttons, but double functions for those, momentary, and hold. Battery life is more like 4 days over the prior 7 days. Has gesture controls on separate screen for thing like changing channels and volume. You define activities such as Watch TV or play Xbox, then program the tethered remote with the new instructions. Some corrections can be made on the remote itself. Hard to setup but works It's a pain to setup. Logitech has professionals that will do it for you for free but they are slow.Once it's setup the only downfall is line of sight. Needs perfect LOS to all the devices it accesses which is a potentially huge problem if your receiver is on the left and the TV is on the right or something worse. Everything Great-One problem. Works like a dream. The problem seems to be that you now need to download the installation program from the Website. I only needed to transfer my current settings onto a new replacement remote. However hard I tried, I could not get the settings to transfer. But, it finally did download and is fine. Great remote Once you get used to where the buttons are this remote is one of the best I've used. Great Remote Works very well . Very easy to program especailly if you already have aHarmony remote . Just copy the settings from the Harmony website.Very happy with the remote. great remote this remote replaced an older model and i was able to get all our accesories on one unit rather then many remotes Slow and does not support RF like they advertise I was looking to replace my Harmony One with something more up to date and this was my choice. I chose this because of my One but this was a bad choice. First of all it was advertised as being able to control the PS3 and Xbox One via RF. This was not the case. The remote will not do RF at all. It is slow, feels clunky, and has HORRIBLE battery life. I was barely able to get 3 days out of a charge where my One can go for almost a month. Over all, to me, this is a huge step backwards from the Harmony One. Avoid this unless you have no other options. Fantastic and Easy Pull it out of the box, go to the web sight, enter the make and model of components, and the remote programs itself. Works instantly! I was able to put 5 remotes in the drawer. What's better? Anyone can pick up the remote and watch cable, a dvd, or Netflix with a push of a button.... Simple, Elegant, a Great Improvement for Logitech Purchased for my wife, who hates all things tech...setup was easy, operation is intuitive, interface is robust and elegant...a most excellent purchase! Breeze to use Everyone in the house loves it. Was breeze to setup, transferred settings from old remote. Remote saves time Harmony Ultimate One Universal remote controls multiple units attached to the Samsung 4K TV. Easy on/off buttons control TV, Receiver, and Blu-ray player all at once. Only concern is that the touch screen channel numbers must be precisely hit to change channels. Almost alwayshave to use two hands. Great Remote For Anyone What a great product. Easy to set up and use. Definitely would recommend to anyone. Full featured remote The remote features are very good. Nice lighted hey board and every device I needed was supported by Logitech. A lot of thought has gone into the layout. I would have given five stars except not having a physical page down/up button is a bit of a drag. You have to use the virtual one buried on the third page of features. One other reason 4 stars not five is because the battery life isn't stellar. Good Harmony remote I purchased this as an upgrade to the Harmony One that I had. Over time the Harmony Ones keys were starting to stick (common fate when you have kids even older ones like mine). This was a great upgrade. This remote charges vertically which reduces the amount of space it needs on my couch side table. Plus we can add all our favorite channels and the remote shows the channel logos right on the screen.Setting it up was a breeze. Supply the model numbers of the devices and it all works as I wanted the very first time. A good universal remote I love this remote. I was using my smartphone with the My Harmony app and Hub to control my devices, which worked great. I just didn't like the impact the app had on my phone's battery, but this remote solved that problem for me. Fantastic Remote I wanted a remote that could handle all of my electronics and this one fits the bill. It handles all the equipment. It is easy to use and has a help button that will trouble shoot any issues (I have not had any). I could not be happier with this remote. Much better feel than my old Harmony Touch I already own the Harmony Touch for almost 2 years and although the Ultimate looks identical to the old Touch, the feel of the Ultimate is much better. The Ultimate feels slightly heavier, sturdier, the back of remote is textured so holding it feels more secured. I also love that you get a slight vibrating feedback whenever you touch the screen or buttons. This is my third Harmony remote with the first being the Harmony 880. The MyHarmony software is easy too work with when configuring the remote. The $200 on sale price is a big pill to swallow for a remote but convenience is priceless. This is a great remote This is a great remote to get if you want to eliminate the clutter and steps of using multiple remotes. One remote Finally we have only one remote instead of 5! This remote is very easy to use. Love it! The one to rule them all The harmony remote does control all of my devices. It's a bit sluggish on the remote interface but all in all it does what you need it do. If you want to stop using all your remotes do yourself a favor & pick one up. Yes and Sale person recommend this one I like this product, but wish I went with the one with voice command Hmmm it is going to take patients. When it works it works great. I've had the older model time to upgrade. Older one worked great still trying to get this one working all the time. It just going to take time to get it all figured out. I would recommend it if you like a small challenge. You might get it in one sitting. Great remote. It took me about two weeks to finally get used to the remote and I love it. Don't get discouraged at first. Take your time to set it up and get used to all the features. Good buy. Different than regular remotes... WE were tired of having 5 romotes laying around. Our Best Buy Guy suggested this Harmony remote. Geek squad set it up for us when they delivered our tv and blu-ray. I'm a Mac person, so it seemed pretty user friendly to me with it's menus. My husband is not really a Mac person, so it took just a little bit, but I think he finds it's user friendly. Have to put it in the stand to recharge when it gets low...not used to that. Sensitive remote We found this remote difficult to use because it is so sensitive. It took several tries to enter three digits for a TV station, because it wanted to go to the station represented by the first or second digit. Also, it won't""talk"" to our Bose sound system, so we had to use the Bose remote and this one...so it wasn't very universal. In short, we returned it in frustration. Easy to use This remote is the best purchase I have made. It's ease of use, and I don't have to have 5 remote controls anymore! Great remote control! We purchased this remote to enable us to manage several items: TV, DVR, Blue-ray player, XM radio, and multi-CD player. This eliminated many remotes!! It works like a charm. Great Product for the price Remote was easy to set up and worked exactly as designed. I did need some help with the technical department in setting up the sequence of when the TV, Cable box, blue ray, etc came on. Tech was very knowledgeable and walked me thru the issue and the fix. Very happy Really like this remote This replaced an older harmony remote that we were very happy with but which was dying. Generally love the form factor on the harmony ultimate one and it feels great in the hand. It contols my tv, av receiver and blu-ray player without any issue (after some tweaking). My biggest complaint is that I don't like having the control buttons above the screen. Otherwise, it was easy to set up and it has passed the wife test (wife generally hates any new technology I bring into the house). Excellent remote but not enough I am a long time user of Logitech remotes. I purchased this to replace my previous one. Unfortunately, this did not provide RF capability and so I upgraded it to a Harmony Elite which I believe is a better remote for the money. Best Remote Ever Very easy to program. Controls all your gadgets. This is the best remote ever. You can personalize it with pictures and phrases. Easy to use anyone can use this. Very nice remote Overall the remote is great! Just wish the battery life was a little better. We mainly use it in the evening for a few hours and after 2 days it is dead. Amazing The setup is what blew me away. You charge it, turn it on, plug it into computer, select your devices save settings and done! It took 30 min to sync and create an entire list of devices and quick key settings to do specific tasks!Its great! great remote This remote handles all of my needs. Upgraded from the 700. Not as Good as Original Harmony One This remote is decent, but not as good as the Original One. The button layout is not well thought out. The FF button is at the top above the touch screen. When ever I am using the remote to control my DVR and I fast forward through commercials, my hand hits the touch screen and changes the channel. The work around for this is to scroll off the Favorites screen, bit it's still very annoying. Great Easy to use once you get used to time out on entering channel. Set up by Rick at Geek Squad Mekbourne Fl to many screens just ot change channels Not a good product. Takes to long in just making channels changes. Great One control makes my total system much easier to use. Perfect remote. Great remote. Logitech hits it out of the park. Works with all my devices. Battery could stand to last longer on a charge. Had to replace older model. Newer more high tech than the last one. Geek squad programmed. Works as advertised This one replaced an aged Logitech that was probably 7 or 8 years old. We liked the idea of a charging station instead of a cord hanging out of the wall that the old one used. The display is great. The touch screen is easy to see and works as it should. My only regret is that you still have to point and shoot. Otherwise, it's great. Try to get it on sale. BB has often advertises it on their website as an afternoon GET IT sale! it works almost everything in my house works almost every thing in my house............... Combine all remotes Great way to combine all remotes in the house. Have very easy setup via computer. Awesome remote for multiple devices I have multiple brands of AV equipment, and this remote is very easy to program. It links the correct pieces for the desired activity. I highly recommend this remote. Easy to navigate! After the basic setup, which was simple enough, the remote works great and controls all the devices I need. Makes me feel more organized! Great remote This is my 2nd Harmony remote. For some reason I had trouble programming and it still will not work with my Samsung DVR box from Optimim. I will have to manually teach it commands. What a pain! Love it I have two of these remotes. I love having all my devices controlled with on one remote. Frustrating Junk Controlling three devices simultaneously; TV, Cable Box, & Bose Audio. Frequently fails to turn on the cable box or audio device; help works to turn on the failed device, but requires more steps than necessary. Charter Cable digital stations are all three digit selections, the Harmony frequently fails to send all three numbers and may send one or two resulting in an unwanted selection. All this from about 8 feet away from the receiver. Save your money unless you enjoy frustration. Great Remote Really love this remote as I can now use one remote to control everything. Takes a while to program everything at first but once you have everything programmed it is great. Sometimes annoying that you have to be pointing it directly at the tv or cable box so it will pick up the signal of what you are trying to do. Overall it is a great control! Only remote to have I have several Logitech Harmony remotes...880, One, and Ultimate One. The Ultimate One is very easy to program, though I have not set it up for smart TV web surfacing or movie streaming, I at least have instruction on how to do. Pretty much connect to your computer and Logitech website, enter your makes and models of equipment, update the remote and your are done. Logitech had made one big improvement in their website for remotes, in that you can now have multiple remotes in one account, copy all settings for one and program another, etc. Takes the pain out of programming a remote. Highly recommend. I would say that I have a basket of remotes being unused...but guess who get to hold the Harmony? The wife...I get stuck with others....Hey, why don't I just buy another one? Just what I needed! Couldn't be happier! Going from 7 remotes, now, just 1. Should have made this investment long ago.... great remote I enjoy this remote, once you get use to learning how to change between option to control the unit you are using. It is amazing at how it learns every control that my electronic has on the original remote. It is not for beginners as it can be frustrating if you are not that savvy with electronics. However if you are it is a wonderful remote and it does learn and can control all of you electronics in your home.I have all my TV's, all my Blu-ray, sound bars, receivers, it will control any electric you add to this device.I do recommend this product. good looking remote control looks good but has some issues over price,will not work with Bluetooth device's also they made it way to complicated to program device's Great Remote The Harmony is my go to remote, I've set this remote up for myself and others. The harmony is very easy to setup, specially if you are just doing basic activities. For regular users the only time I would recommend help with installation is if you want second zones, special buttons, etc programmed into the remote. Remote The Harmony Remote is handy to use if the hole operation would be explained at a slower instruction. Great Nephew showed proper usage. Like the older model better, Like the older model better, this model I have to have the doors opened. Screen is very sensitive..wish there was a better alternative. excellent very easy to operate and fancy too. my little computer Great remote Bought this for my husband he was using 4 remotes. He loves it. Love it I love Harmony remotes. I hate having to use several remotes to watch TV or a movie and this takes care of that. Easy to program. Love it Really easy to program. Easy to use. kid friendly. Nice remote I like the remote. It does not have to be pointed directly at the TV/DVR/Blu-ray to operate. I even went upstairs and tried it there to see, and it still worked. Several options available. The only downside is the TV channel number buttons don't always work properly, but I was able to set up the stations I want to watch so it's not been that big a problem. Logitech's great standard Replaced a 9 series remote and I got the same functionality with less buttons - family now sold on itI have linked it to a hub as wellI was concerned looking at it that I was going to loose options but all is well in a better designed packageTo Logitech The speed of your website is slow especially start up/ logging in The issue is not my internet speed. Consequently it took some time to set up Very sensitive. Controls are overly sensitive and small. Prefer Sony remote supplied with the TV. Great remote I love the latest edition of the harmony remotes! The layout of the buttons is eprgonominaly good. You can do so much with the touch screen. I just started experimenting with the color buttons on the bottom and what they do! Nice surprises! I highly recommend this remote to anyone considering. Great remote Great remote and programs easy with a computer. One remote to do everything.. Wife loves this !!! Thanks Does more than I need but there is some fumbling t Does more than I need but it's touch screen is a temperamental thing. Sleek, but not as sexy as previous models This remote looks good, obviously not as good as some of the previous models, but it'll do. Works as it should. The ""Help"" button isn't as easy to find as on my last Harmony, and I'm not really a fan of the ""hold for skip"" double function of the ff button. Got it for a great price, though. I really like this remote. I recommend this remote to anyone looking to combine all their electronics with one remote. SUPER EASY TO PROGRAM -- great, smart remote I was one of those people who said that I would never pay for a universal remote, especially one over $50. I mean, how lazy must you be not to be able to use the remotes that came with your devices -- right? That was until I was hunting for my missing Roku remote and, in the process, discovered that I had 13 remotes in my 2-bedroom apartment. Between the streaming device remotes, the TVs, the gaming stations, the blu-ray player and soundbar, my coffee tables and night stand were cluttered with remotes. That's the time that I started thinking -- just thinking -- about a universal remote. When I saw that Logitech's One remote was for sale (for 50% off) I decided to jump on the opportunity. I was intimidated at first, but Logitech's software was SO EASY to use. I simply entered the model numbers of my devices and Logitech worked through the rest of the programming and automatically worked out the combo functions like turning on the TV and soundbar, changing the TV input and turning on the gaming console when I want to play Xbox. It works flawlessly! Now I carry around one remote to control all the audio/video components in my apartment. This remote is okay but that's about it. I'm having trouble turning my Wii game system on. It doesn't say Wii, it says X-Box. Then again, I'm a dinosaur and it could be me with the problem. Very good remote!!! This is a really good remote. Would be perfect if the touch screen was at the top instead of in the middle of the remote. Overly sensitive Too easy for you to barely touch it and something totally different appears. If you don't touch it just right, you never know what you will see. And you can't leave it on the charger, so if you run your charge down, the remote is inoperable. A charge only lasts 3 days. Battery operated would be better. My husband calls it garbage. One to rule them all Easy to use and control everything in your home. somethings you will need the hub. Great gift Love this product. Great gift. Endless fun if you're a gadget lover. EXCELLENT PRODUCT Synced right up to my equipment. Works Great! Has trouble connecting every now and then but with the fix it now button it fixes the issue right away. Vary good product Vary easy to program , love the recharge option place charging stand when trough for the night always ready the next day, pair well with all my devices Good remote Overall this is a good remote. The IR transmitter is very strong. But it's easy to hit the wrong button on the touch screen. I don't like that the off button is so close to rewind as well. Super easy to use for all the family I was nervous about my dad and girlfriend using this remote. But its played out and worked well. The battery dies pretty quick when its left on the bed because it lights up every time someone moves. But I'm happy with the remote purchase. Good universal remote for the price. Good remote overall. Must use computer with internet connection to program. Poor battery life between charges. Just Ok.. It's a great device if you have multiple devices; however, I don't like that you have to switch devices to turn the volume up or down for the television. Logtech is a excellent brand I had another remote same brand so i decided to try one of their high end remotes.....we love it Effective replacement As universal remotes go, this one is relatively effective and easy to use. Like a lot of universal remotes, getting to certain equipment specific features to do any AV equipment ""tinkering"" can be a little cumbersome. But at least it's possible using the universal remotes extensive digital menus without having to grab the original OEM remotes. For normal everyday use, it's quite convenient for setups that might include the combination of an AV receiver, cable/satellite box, streaming box, Blu-ray, TV or more. No need to have multiple remotes laying around to control primary functions of the peripherals. And for the most part, I rarely have to dig out one of the equipment specific remotes. But I'd probably keep them available (maybe in a drawer or cabinet nearby) if you like to tinker often with equipment specific settings, although it's not absolutely necessary. With a little patience scrolling through the remote digital menu, you'll find just about any function the OEM remotes can perform, and sometimes even more. Works great, but a little ""buggy"" I purchased the Harmony Smart Control (hub + remote) when it was on sale, and loved NOT having the touchscreen. The problem with this setup for me though, was it did not have the IR built into the remote, which I needed for my TV (too far away from hub or IR blasters). I ended up purchasing this remote, which is much more deluxe, but I personally like having the numerical buttons available at all times and find that whatever is on the screen is not what I want on the screen. I'm sure I'll get it all setup the way I wanted, but so far, my wife has had issues using it. She's not great with electronics, but she's been ""stuck"" when things freeze up or are not working correctly. Always wanted one of these Great remote very easy to program. It controls everything Powerful Remote I found the Logitech Harmony One to offer excellent screen readability and easy to add new functions on the down loaded app. The signal is strong and dependable. The activity screen is somewhat difficult for me to scroll without activating a function that I am not interested in. I think there should be a right hand scrolling bar like web sites. Otherwise, I am satisfied with my purchase. It is pretty good Bought it to replace an old harmony. Paired it with my harmony hub. It's good but the price is a little you high for what it delivers. Awesome This remote was so easy to set up. And once set up the response time is so much better than my older harmony remote and a little more forgiving on pointing it at my entertainment center. It's a solid buy when on sale. Overpriced The remote work when it wanted to. It would turn things on when it wasn't supposed to and it was awkward to hold. Good remote We had a Logitech 1100 before this one and we loved it so when I stopped working we knew we had to get this one Works fine Took some ""Tweeking"" but we have 5 things running off of it. Geek Squad did a fine job installing it. Overall a great remote but have my reservations The remote was not a smooth install for me to pair up with my existing Hub to replace the remote I had which died after a year. The battery life is shorter than expected and the touch screen can be over sensitive, but it does exactly what I expected it to do. I am holding out on one extra star due to past experience with Logitech hub remote for quality, let's see how long this will last before it breaks, if it doesn't last at least 10 years then it is garbage to me. Good but not great Really like the fact that i can control all the devices in my entertainment area, but with one caveat. The controller has issues with my sound bar and occasionally cannot either power it on or off. A friend of mine purchased one with me and is reporting similar issues with their sound bar. Very convenient Easy to see display, helps with clutter only one remote on the table Great product. This is a great remote with lots of features. Easy to install and easy to use. Setting it up was quick and easy. Love-Hate Does everything it's supposed to but touch screen has an irritating delay when first using the screen Uggggh! Programmed it myself, didn't work. Had Geek Squad out twice ... still doesn't work. A waste of $250. Less This product does it all. I only need the one remote no more clutter on my tv stand. Luv this product. Good remote with sensitive touch controls Handles a wide variety of device combinations. Touch screen controls may be accidentally selected (use locking feature to minimize bad effects). It is wise to include all available devices in each selection to allow continued operations on one device when switching to view another. Great remote Works well with the tv an cable box. I love the ability to store favorite channels with the remote. Disappointing I purchased this to replace my beloved harmony one. This can't hold a candle to the harmony one. It's curved bottom prevents it from resting flatly on a table. It is so sensitive I can't pick it up without triggering some random function. It is uncomfortable to hold and quite difficult to operate. Overall, a big disappointment. Does anyone have a harmony one they want to sell? Works Great Once programmed, this remote is fantastic. Only click once and the tv turns on and goes to the desired channel. ! Once you program the remote it will do everything you want and the best part is that you can control all your a/v equipment with just one control.Best remote I have ever owned. Hard to set up I read reviews on this remote, however, it was hard to use with my Sonos sound system and Samsung 65"" tvVery confusing, better off with a much more simple all in one remote Life changer Works great with all my products.Little bit of a lag, but not an issue for me. Great universal remote Consilidated 5 remotes into one and we live it! So much easier. I do not know why I didn't do it sooner This is an amazing device that operates 5 devices in my case and works flawlessly. I could not be happier to get rid of the pile of remotes! Works with any model TV Setting up this remote to my Pioneer ELITE was easy as 123. Simply elegant Simple lay out. Totally customizable. Bought one, after while gave set up to my folks. They love it. Bought this older simpler remote again because I love the button simplicity. Not a huge fan We wanted an all in one remote to use for all of our devices. My husband did the research which showed this one to be the best. After using it for 6 months we completely disagree. The ergonomics of the remote aren't right, the screen on it gets touched accidentally all the time causing problems, and its difficult to switch from one device to another. Would return it if we could. After paying that much for a stupid remote we will have to think long and hard about wasting that much money on another one. Awesome Remote I have never written a review before, but this remote deserves one. We had four remotes to watch TV or watch a movie . And now just one. It is AWESOME. I was worried the set up would be complicated or not work. However Harmony's web site was very easy to follow and simply walks you through the whole set up step by step. It walks you through the set up of activities and your favorite TV Channels. If I can do it anyone can!I was so impressed that it motivated me to write this review.I would highly recommend this remote!!! Great Device! I purchased the Harmony Ultimate One to replace my aging Harmony 1100. I like the one handed form factor of the Ultimate One, the ease of set up and use. One remote to control all of your home theater devices. The battery typically lasts me 2-3 days. For some reason I remember my Harmony 1100 lasting me a bit longer than that, but it is not a deal breaker. I just needed to train myself to remember to drop it on the charger more frequently. I chose the Ultimate One over the more expensive Harmony Ultimate because I do not have any of my devices hidden in cabinets that would require the IR blasters or the Harmony Hub. Very easy remote to use Excellant remote, and is easy to use, and the geek squad easily set it up to my Smart TV. Fantastic Product--totally delivered I've been waiting 4 years for my home theater set up. Adding this Harmony remote totally accentuates everything about it. I love it and my partner, who is technology challenged, finds it easy to use as well. It's easy to program and when you add the app on our iPhones, it just couldn't be simpler. Bravo to Logitech for a great product that I will enjoy for years! Great product, extremely easy to use The Logitech universal remote was a breeze to program with my 6 elements and is very easy to use and has great performance. Strongly recommend this universal control! Great all-in-one remote. Able to hide all components in one cabinet and control them with one remote. Remote needed for anyone with multiple. This remote does wonders and easy to use. I recommend anyone to get geek squad to set it up. Too confusing for me. Great multi-component remote Overall a great remote. Only drawback I have seen is that some of the functions are now handled through the screen which makes them a little less easy to use. Everything else works great. Remote for all TV needs I love my remote!! It syncs with my surround sound receiver, tv, dvd player, vcr, wii, crome cast, song stream and cable box to day the least. One touch of the button and remote turns on all required equipment. Love have one remote, instead of 6 !!! Smaller and easier to use then the last generation I had an older version that stopped working. I use it to control several components. This upgraded model is easier to use. Great unit but NOT FOR PS3!!! unit is simply amazing but will NOT work with PS3 unless you buy a hub with it. Hassle I had an earlier version of this model. Two things about it were too big of a hassle.1. It was very easy to accidentally have duplicate buttons on the screen for the same device. I think I spent more time with it plugged into the computer than I spent actually using it.2. You know how you can eventually learn where the buttons on a remote are, and you don't have to look at it? You just kind of feel for the buttons? You can't do that with this thing because the buttons on the screen keep changing position.Also, while the battery is charging, you have to use the old remotes anyway. Very easy to use I found this remote to be very simple to set up and it worked right away with no problems. I kind of wish that the play, fast forward, rewind (etc) buttons were on the bottom instead of the top as I seem to activate the touch screen a lot. But, just a minor complain. Highly recommend and it works with every device every time. Great Remote This is a replacement of my Logitech Harmony one, which I loved. Still getting used to the differences, but love it. Easy to use after the Geek Squad set it up Definitely get the Geek Squad to set this up!! Well worth the $99. for set up. Now we can flip between audio and video devices with a push of one button. Very easy to use Screen is way too sensitive and gets locked up The touch screen is way too sensitive and you can easily lock up the entire remote. If you try cleaning the screen in a room separate from the items you control it senses an operation and since it does not get a response back from the devices locks up. Have had to reset the control to fctory settings several times in order for it to function period. Great product We love this product. I bought a Samsung TV floor model and it was missing remote. I was told that this remote would work like the Samsung remote and let me tell you it is the best. Highly recommend it. Mehhh Really disappointed after loving previous models like the Harmony One. Doesn't hold a charge very long, will stop sending out signals for no apparent reason, and the software seems more buggy than earlier versions. Amazing remote for whole system Best all around remote to control my entire system Great for interactive control of several devices I had my old harmony for 8 years and it was super, but the graphics faded and I could not control my devices, I tried the lesser expensive harmony that works with the iPhone, but could not program it correctly, so I bought this model and it's great. Easy to program and works like a charm. The best universal controler Our last remove was also a Harmony. The only way to go. Our other one had the bottom worn off. It was time, even though it's pricy, worth every penny! Great Remote This remote handles all my needs that combine all my remotes in one and is easy to use for a beginner. Great remote Great remote, controls multiple devices, activity based, and easy to program Awesome remote Easy to program and use. Excellent range. Much improved over the earlier models. I think Logitech took a step backwards with this This is my third Logitech Harmony remote. I don't care for the design of this one compared to previous models. Eliminate the number pad on a remote ? really?? Favorites are a very nice feature, but don't replace the need for a number pad and I don't care for the one offered on the touch screen. (my husband HATES it). Setup was tough since I already had the 'software' installed on my laptop and the the packinging/instructions did not make it clear that you needed to download and install NEW software from a different vendor. Took a phone call to support to get it cleared up. I find it very odd (and a poor design decision) that you can't manage all of the features from the software. Some things you have to do on the remote..some things in the software. CONFUSING! All in all - I just don't care for this release which is a shame because I have loved this line of removtes. Once I got the proper software installed - setup was easy and straightforward as I have come to expect from Logitech. The remote has been mostly reliable and has mostly worked properly. I wish I had a new purchase my old Harmony One... Great remote nice to have one instead of trying to use multiples. Poor design The bad: It's a two handed remote. By that I mean that you have to hold it in your hand to use it. You can't just leave it on the end table or other surface and reach over and push a button on it because the bottom is rounded. Another design flub is that the transport keys are located above the touch screen ! If you want to push play, rewind, pause etc., and you brush your hand across the touch screen before it times out you'll change the channel, or something else. Very irritating!! The good: It's very easy to program, and the charging cradle it a winner ! Three Stars Do what it's supposed to do. Reaction time of the remote control can be faster. Programming via the computer was an arduous and timely process ... Programming via the computer was an arduous and timely process, there was significant lag between clicking and the program registering the input. Don't know about you, but we need this! I have had a logitech harmony remote for about 10 years and wouldn't want to have to deal without one. One touch turns on the TV and my Sony sound system/dvd player and the it is ready to watch tv by controlling my Tivo and volume etc. This new one has updated features like a touch screen and it is taking some time for me to get used to. It functions differently than my previous model but is much more flexible and can do much more with less programming. I think this one might be easier (less techy) to set up because now you don't have to do so much of your own programming, but instead you have to learn how to use the devices feature. But in the end, we watch a samsung tv, change the channels on a Tivo and control surround sound from our Sony home theater and if we chose to, we can record a program on our Toshiba DVD burner using nothing but this one Logitech programmable remote. Five Stars gave as a gift Five Stars Good Maybe mine is a dud First let me say I bought my Harmony Ultimate One from Dell, not Amazon. I had been using a harmony remote with fewer functions and really liked it.But I've had so much trouble with this one. This remote has a feature that you press if the remote didn't carry out all the steps you asked it to perform. For instance, if you want to watch roku, the remote is supposed to turn on the television and sound bar and change the television HDMI to the one that Roku is on. I'd say 6 out of 10 times, I've had to ask Harmony to fix it. Eventually, it does fix it, but as often as not, it takes several attempts. About 50 of the time, the off button doesn't work. And finally, there's not much life to the battery.....and that's been true from the get-go. I really wish I hadn't bought this thing! The most infuriating remote I've ever used. The button ... The most infuriating remote I've ever used. The button layout is an ergonomic nightmare. The weight distribution is so uneven, it falls constantly - off a table, off an armchair, out of your hand. The back is so over contoured and slick that you have to place it face down to stay on anything but a completely flat surface, but then you risk triggering the absurdly sensitive touch screen. Oh, the touch screen!!!! Be careful not to breathe on the damn thing or you'll be restarting your system or changing functions constantly and without warning. Did I mention that the battery life is godawful and you must charge it - no removable battery option. Avoid at all costs. Bought the Harmony 700 at Best Buy its working great Four weeks of frustration trying to set it up. Customer service is only via email and most of their solutions were generic. Gave up returned it. Bought the Harmony 700 at Best Buy its working great! Five Stars Superb ! Five Stars East to program off the internet for a non-stereo component expert. It waste time at start up updating my device when there ... For such an expensive device, the software is pure stupidity. It waste time at start up updating my device when there is nothing to update. I mean, wait until I change something, then update.That said, I have to fall back on my device remotes everyday because this device is little more that an on switch.I wish I had saved my money. Absolutely fantastic remote, easy to setup Absolutely fantastic remote, easy to setup, tons of features! And if you have an existing Harmony remote you can just transfer your settings right over the new one with no fuss. Not happy with this item it doesn't work as well as ... Not happy with this item it doesn't work as well as my old one. I have problems with the touchscreen This ruins the Harmony product line for me. Of all the Harmony remotes that I've owned over the years, this is by far my least favorite.Weaknesses:Lack of physical number buttons (This is of course a design choice by Harmony. I just don't like it)Lack of IR spread - This remote must be pointed directly at the devices you're trying to controlSlowness - Takes a long time to turn all the devices on. This used to be a configurable setting in the old software.Software usability - Compared to the old harmony software, the new version is watered down regarding functionality and lacks usability / intuitiveness.Operational issues - I have to hard reset this thing once a week or so because the screen stops turning offStrengths:Controls all my IR devicesPrice was good as I got it on saleI'll look elsewhere when it comes time to replace this.Harmony remotes I've owned in the past for various family members / locations. Of all of these, this is the worst:Harmony 1 - The best by farHarmony Touch - Very similar to the Ultimate in feel but works way better.Harmony 700 - Solid and affordableHarmony 880 - Great remote until the dog got itThere's another silver version that I haven't had to mess with in so long I even forget the model . Excellent product! I am not tech savvy at all ... Excellent product! I am not tech savvy at all and this is so easy to use. I LOVE IT!!! Not worth it Found myself not really using this anymore. Touch screen is a nice idea, but I've found that I prefer just remembering where the buttons are so I don't have to look at my remote so often to see what I'm pushing. Great Remote Once you get the hang of it, it's amazing! I love this remote I love this remote. It synced with my TV, cable box and sonos sound bar. I can now control all my devices with one remote. It also allows me to use my smart tv functions like Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu. Great remote! Pays for itself In battery savings alone this remote pays for itself. Just look around your house and you will see how much battery dependency you have alreeady Almost there I got this through the vine program.We already have the Ultimate + hub for our living room. So I got this for our bedroom setup.Set up. Amazingly easy and the Logitech database of electronics they can support is extensive and even had my old Westinghouse monitor. Updating the firmware is painless too.Use. This is where Logitech comes up a little short thus the 4 stars. The touch screen is either too sensitive or not sensitive enough. Sometimes when I swipe or click a button it works and other times it doesn't. I really don't know what I am doing wrong. But the touch screen and the several pages (swipe left/right) really makes things convenient.Also provides the 30 second fast forward for my Comcast DVR and 15 second jump back.An incredibly impressive piece of hardware. Battery life is great. And firmware updates come fast and regularly. Get it. You won't be disappointed! WOW! What a great remote.I bought a new Samsung Soundbar that for whatever reason Samsung didn't design it to turn on AND off with the TV. It was one or the other depending on how you connected it (Optical or HDMI). I spoke with a co-worker who raved about this remote and thought that it might work. I gave it a try and to my amazement, it worked!Not only that, but it also easily controls all of my devices.Would highly recommend. Five Stars Works great. Love it. Buy it now to get rid of multiple remotes! Second remote and it's as great as the first with the hub. Cannot go wrong with this for all your entertainment needs in any room. This one is in our living room but it works just as well as the original with hub in our bedroom. Five Stars It is the best product. I am really satisfied. Very useful but needs a headphone jack This is a preliminary review after a week or so of use. I have now retired five remotes including my previous Logitech Harmony 510. The remote has a nice feel and is easy to operate. Occasionally, it skips. By that I mean, when I choose one thing, I get another, but infrequently and it is not a major problem.It takes a while to find something but I am sure this will improve with use. The learning curve is probably more steep than with the 510 and I'm still searching for things however, the menu layout is reasonably logical so that is a help. One thing I miss from my 510 is the ability to skip forward 30 seconds or backwards 10 seconds when watching a recording. That is an extremely useful tool that should be incorporated in the next model...or did I miss itAnother thing I really wish could be incorporated into remotes, including this one, is the feature on the Roku remote: a headset plugin capability. This is extremely useful since it eliminates long cords. Perhaps future models.Overall, I am quite (not yet very) happy with the HUO remote and expect to continue using it for a number of years. Not recommended We have always bought Harmony remotes and Were very happy with them. However, this remote is a Big disappointment. Not easy to Set up. Not easy to use at all. To much screen swiping to get to the function you want. Screen is too sensitive. Buttons are small and easy to mistress. Not happy with his purchase. I do not recommend. Dissappointed I downloaded the Harmony software. I setup the tv and cable box then hit the sync button. It didn't sync. I tried on another computer. Same thing. I called support and followed their instructions. Same problem. Called tech once more. Same instructions. Tried once more. Same problem. Disappointed. I have a Harmony 6 years old and have never had a problem. I returned the Ultimate. Piece of junk!! This is an update from a previous review. I have had this remote for about a year now and it is absolute garbage. There is not one single time that it operates as programed and I don't have to use the help button to finish the programmed function. The remote has been programmed multiple times and all of the functions work but not with the push of one button like it's supposed to, you always have to use help. This remote is a complete let down and a waste of 250. Do not waste your money. Good Products, When attempting to get a refund for ... Good Products, When attempting to get a refund for the difference on a sale it was a hassle and did not work out but I am super happy with the device. Easy to program and custom setting Easy to program and custom setting. (also work with Android TV box)Cons: Can't have different list of favorite channels. (Direct TV, TV antenna). Harmony 700 can do. Works great for me I never thought I could get excited over a remote control, but I did with this one. First of all, let me state that I was on the fence after reading the reviews here on Amazon, but I took the plunge and so far I'm not regretting it. This is my first Harmony remote, so I obviously can't make comparisons with previous models which might have been better than the unit presently under review.It took me 30 to 45 minutes to set up and sync my new remote through the Harmony software. That was a breeze, but it's important that you know your system and how its individual components are connected to each other. All my components were supported by the remote, so no problems there. I was able to customize the background image on the touchscreen. A nice touch, though not very important.Once the first sync from software to remote is completed, the remote will work on your system. As opposed to the previous situation, where you had four remotes lying around, you will now hit one button ('activity') and your TV, AV receiver and third component will turn on all at once. Great! At first this does not work flawlessly. For instance, you hit 'Watch TV' and everything might come on, but the AV receiver won't be on the right channel. The great thing about this remote, though, is that it learns on the job: It will ask you if the function performed as desired, and if not, how it can improve. After my initial use with every component, these flaws were pretty much ironed out. I now have a perfect remote with no issues whatsoever.One downside to all this automation is that the Harmony cannot predict when you've been fooling around with your equipment behind its back. Turned off your TV by hand using that device's own power button The Harmony doesn't know, so when you switch everything off through the remote (again: just ONE button), your TV will come back on again. You can work around this by customizing the color buttons on the bottom of the remote to be separate power on/off buttons for the individual components. You'll need to customize these buttons for every programmed activity, so there's an initial time investment involved. And of course there are no markings for these functions on the remote, so you'll have to memorize everything. All in all this is not ideal.If you want to nitpick, a few other minor cons are: 1) the sluggish touchscreen and 2) slightly flimsy buttons. This is nothing I can get worked up about.None of the downsides mentioned above can put a damper on my excitement. I'm very happy with this product. I'm still a tiny bit worried about the negative reviews and, subsequently, the longevity of this remote. Time will tell, and I'll adjust my rating if this thing fails within the first year or so. So far I'd highly recommend it. Great product! Definitely disappointed This is my second Logitech Harmony remote. I had my first one for eight years and loved it.I HATE this remote!!!Yes hate.Honestly, I don't even think it should be in the same category as my old Harmony remote. This version is a significant downgrade. The buttons have far less customization, the our old remote. The layout of the buttons on the remote lack a comfortable feel and placement. The removal of the number buttons in favor of the touch screen might not seem like a big deal. But instead of being about to press in 300 for your favorite channel you now need to: Touch the Screen Swipe to unlock If it doesn't come up to the number screen you have to flip through the screens to find the numbers Then enter the 300Who at Logitech thought doubling the number of keystrokes needed made any sense at all I certainly don't!I will say, this remote does eliminate the need for multiple remotes. But the downsides of this remote really don't make me happy about the amount of money that it cost. Now everything is fine, as long as I make sure to keep ... Took some time to set everything up. It had some problems with my TV (somehow skipping some inputs when switching modes) but that started working at some point (not sure what exactly I changed). Now everything is fine, as long as I make sure to keep pointing the remote to the devices while it is doing 'its thing' which takes longer than normal remotes. Five Stars Works great and easy to set up It was easy to hook up to our 4 different units We've been using it for about a month now and no complaints. It was easy to hook up to our 4 different units, also it has a learn feature so if there is something that's not working right you can customize it and make it work better. It is not getting better all the time. I purchased this to replace my Harmony one, which I loved. This remote was more expensive and vastly inferior. The ergonomics are terrible. The remote cannot be operated effectively with one hand. To reach the hard buttons at the top, one invariably activates the touch screen by mistake. In general, there are too few hard buttons (like HELP) requiring you to look down at the touch screen unnecessarily. In addition, the touch screen is not sensitive enough and frequently does not recognize taps. The swipe feature (which is nice in theory) is also not sensitive and often requires do-overs. After 4 months of babying (i.e., not letting the kids use it), the top half of the touch screen no longer worked at all. Subsequently found out that free technical support in the US is only available for 90 days (unlike Europe and Asia, which have 2 years and 1 year free phone support respectively). Without technical support, I was close to returning this, but with a little self-help persistence on the website, I was able to figure out how to reboot it (which solved the problem). Still, it should not have to be this difficult. Charging for technical support during the warranty period is a poor business model. Hope this company gets its act back together. Fantastic product - wish I had sprung for this sooner! Brilliant product. I have a somewhat more advanced home entertainment setup with a AV receiver, Roku, DVD, and fairly new Motorola DVR from FiOS and this configured and handled them all perfectly - the first time I set it up.The genius of the product is that it's programmed online and Logitech has thousands of components already identified - and they allow you to check in advance if your devices are directly supported with a look-up utility on their site. I wasn't sure about my Pioneer VSX-33TX THX receiver as it's probably 10 years old, but it was no problem. You connect the remote to your computer, Windows 7 found the drivers online without issue, then go to the Logitech setup site and create an account if you don't already have one. Then you type in the model numbers of everything that you have. If your setup is simple that may be all you need to do, but they take care of multiple 'keypress' needs very elegantly. For example, to play a DVD I have to change the plasma display to HDMI 2, set the AV receiver to DVD input, then turn on the DVD. Logitech's setup anticipated the devices and the inputs that I'd probably be using so all I needed to do was to confirm and save. Then a single touch to the onscreen display on the Harmony does it all.Be aware that like most IR remotes, it wants a pretty straight line-of-site to the components and any glass in between will weaken the signal. My components are all in a cabinet with glass doors about 12 feet from our seating area and remote control wasn't a problem although it was necessary to be pointing fairly directly at the cabinet. If you're not sure about distances or want to be lazy when aiming, pick up and install an IR repeater and it will solve that problem.Honestly, I have nothing negative to say about this device. The ergonomics and setup are inspired and so human friendly that even my wife was impressed. The 200 seems expensive initially but if you consider programming a typical button-only remote can take hours and I had this set up in 15 minutes, it quickly seems like money well spent. If you are a tech junkie like me you will love this remote. This is a great product once you get it all set up. The set up process is a bit time consuming but once it is up and running it works great. If you are a tech junkie like me you will love this remote. Maybe, Maybe Not But Logitech Stands Behind Their Product To preface my review, I am not a technophobe and have programmed other Harmony remotes.After hours of programming and re-reprogramming the remote it still does not operate properly. When I think I have the problem solved the remote fails to perform a basic function like turning on or off my devices. Based on my experience this remote is not as easy as 1-2-3-4 to set up. This is a shame because the remote has some really nice features but all the great features in the world are of no value if the remote doesn't perform basic functions.You might wonder why not call customer service. I did and here is my experience. The bright spot about contacting customer service was that I was able to reach someone without waiting an hour to speak with someone. Also I called at 4:30 pm a half-hour before the service center closes and the customer serve rep worked with me past closing time. Bottom line was the customer service rep attempted to help me and went as far as remotely changing settings on the remote on-line which only made the problem worse. At one point I had to take a quick call and explained that I would put the rep on hold and be right back. As soon as I put the call on hold the rep hung up. No call back in case it was an accidental disconnect. I called back only to find the service center was closed. I was left standing there with my remote in my hand. A remote that did not operate. I was able to re-program the remote so it could operate albeit not properly.I can't recommend this product and urge you not to purchase this product. Clearly the product does not work as advertised and their customer service is pathetic. I will contact customer no-service this week when i have the time and update this review. But in the meantime don't waste your time or money on this remote.Update -We'll it has been almost a week since I wrote my review. Just to be clear none of my components or TV are concealed and well within range. Someone from Logitech contacted me via email (no phone). Unfortunately I am extremely busy during the week and could not speak to Ian Crowe although I did call Logitech in California and left a voice mail for Ian this afternoon. I tried to work with Logitech's customer no-service today. I spoke to someone off-shore somewhere. No help. In fact he tried to tell me my remote was an RF remote. Just to make sure this tech rep was wrong I called Vizio to ensure the remote was an IR remote. It is. Sadly I am still where I was last week. Sending me an email offering to help me is great but I need solutions not empty offers to help. Ian please call me.2nd Update - I have been working with Logitech's Senior Manager for Customer Service in the Bay Area, for the past two Fridays. It looks like the problem has been solved (crossing my fingers). I really appreciate the time and effort that Ian has made to make things right. Logitech is sending an optional hub to try in case the current fix does not work. If I have to return the remote Ian has promised a refund even if I return the remote after 30 days. I hope I don't have to use the hub or return the remote. If I have to return the remote it is not because of Logitech's not trying. I really believe that Ian has gone above and beyond what would be expected.The Bottom Line: This remote might be buggy depending on your AV equipment. But when it works, it works great. So far I really like using the remote. I especially like the favorites screen. I think my tech challenged wife will be able to use the remote too. Logitech has stepped up and helped make a bad situation a good one. I would recommend Logitech to a friend or family member. I changed the title of my review and gave the remote 3 stars from 1 star. Give this a product a shot understanding there could be a problem but Logitech will work with you to make it right. I hope the current fix works and I won't have to return the remote it really is great to use. Great produce Easy to setup, work great. Rate AAA+ Awful design, terrible programming app, poor compatibility Terrible product, if you have ever tried the original Harmony One. Starting with the MyHarmony Windows app (or the browser equivalent myharmony.com) that offer a lot less programmability than the old Harmony Remote Software. Importing existing settings from previous remotes is far from accurate. The Ultimate One was unable to control a Pioneer Elite TV, a Linksys DMA 2200 media center extender, and to understand that I have my media center PC always on. Marred by several device incompatibility and by awful, awful design: how practical is it to have the Play/Pause Skip/Back buttons on top To use the playback controls means pushing buttons at the tip of the remote, so it is not firmly in your hand. Therefore, no one-hand wielding and thumb controls: you need one hand to hold the remote steady and the other to push buttons. The ffwd/skipfwd button combo is not good, despite the haptic feedback, as the extended press is a waste of time and not very accurate because of lag. The touchscreen menus are confusing, bare and unappealing. The scrolling system not very sensitive. I do not want to have to swipe the touchscreen every time I want to access some info or programmed function. It's just another annoying step. There are a hundred more negative things I could say about it. I strongly disliked it, despite being a fan of the half dozen other Harmony remotes that I have programmed over nearly ten years. Not their best effort.... The technology freezes and loops. It also fails toporperly set or turn off single devices in sets. This causes you to have to do troubleshooting and a manual fix. Ready to Purchase I looked at this remote 2 days ago and decided to try the Harmony 650 first to confirm that Logitech's infra red system would with our equipment and because it does I came back to purchase one of these too however, the price jumped by nearly 40.00.Lower the price and I am a customer of this remote too FWIW, the Harmony 650 works flawlessly.Thank you Five Stars Easy to use, great replacement for our old model. Competent but for the premium price lacking premium functionality Okay, semi expert here. This is my fourth Harmony universal remote in about ten years. Perhaps that leads to conclusions about issues of longevity I'm a little torn on that. Yes, they do get daily work, but a little more in the build quality, especially for the steep price, seems warranted. Battery life on the previous models was also not good - I am talking about rechargeable models.Sadly, nobody makes as usable as a remote as Logitech/Harmony. If I am wrong please tell me in the comments - I am willing to switch!While easy to use, easy to set up is not the same thing. If you are tech savvy, it is not too difficult and the biggest challenge is first, getting all your correct model numbers for all your gear, second, knowing enough about how you have all this set up in terms of both audio and video inputs and outputs. Advice, write it down and keep it on file. That is a fair amount of work and takes some knowledge. Unlike my last model, the default button setup for this and my different devices was a bit off. I had to customize button settings for my cable box (FIOS) to properly use the Favorites guide and a few other things including On Demand - that's right, no default button set up for On Demand. In actual use my wife was able to start using it right away, but there are some quibbles here and there on having this be the only remote we need. Back to cable, but some often used functions, like search, are more cumbersome with this than the FIOS remote. We can live with it and let that stay in a drawer, but again, for 250 I think we can all demand a bit more thoughtfulness and user testing. Not to be AV elitist, but I don't think your average person with an average set up is going to shell out 250 for a remote. We want ease of use, but also versatility. FYI, I am running this with a HD TV, audio video receiver and a 5.1 surround setup, FIOS cable box, Roku 4, blueray DVD player and (for old family stuff I am working to convert) an actual VHS VCR!P.S. Swipe gesture thing is a gimmick and not very useful - volume buttons are easier to use. Would have much rather had the effort of this go into lower cost or functionality. Form factor/ergonomics is not the best either. Volume, channel, guide - highly used buttons not in a natural position for the hand. Hire a real Human Factors person please! Five Stars Great product, great price. Great Investment! Probably one of the best investments I could have gotten. Glad it can control my WD TV. The first time I've use only one remote in a long time. Great idea poor engineering Like most people I hate having seven remotes to control my system so combining them into one unit is a great idea. I appreciate the opportunity to review the Ultimate One and compare it to my two-year-old One with the failing buttons. Although the Ultimate One is pretty smart and quite functional in many ways, Logitech misses the mark for me on several important points.Software: Try finding Roku for the Harmony. There are several classifications to look under but none of them make sense for Roku. It's listed under DVD. Go figure. Try Apple TV. Good luck with that one. Brand new hardware (Ultimate One) with the same old crappy software. If they spent a couple of days with a new software team leader in charge, maybe they'd come up with a better system, but this one has irritated me since I bought the old One more than two years ago.Hardware: Improved the shape and size over the old One so that now it stands up in the charging stand, taking up much less room on the table where it sits. Also added a textured back to make it easier to grip. They got rid of the superfluous buttons that cluttered up the old One, but also removed some pretty useful ones. These buttons are now accessed through layers of a touch screen. Sometimes this works out well, and sometimes not. Really depends on your equipment and the type of controlling you need to do. For me, I still keep the original remotes close enough that I can use them to do the more intricate things I don't want to bother setting up and troubleshooting on the Harmony. Yes, troubleshoot. Not everything works right the first time.Some inconveniences: Ever hand your remote to someone so they can control things Well, be careful with the Ultimate. About 1/4 times one of us will accidentally activate something on the touchscreen during transfer from one hand to the other, and we're being careful. Also, for some reason they put the playback buttons (play, FF, REW, etc) above the touchscreen. Try using those without activating something on the touchscreen!Set up: Since I already had a Harmony One that was fine-tuned to my system (which took months to finesse!!!), set up was just a matter of transferring the information from the One to the Ultimate. Easy-cheesy. I don't look forward to learning how to set up the Ultimate for a new piece of equipment after seeing that the software is still the same: lame. For now, the Ultimate controls most things fine with no fuss on my part.If you want to get rid of all of your remotes the Ultimate One could be your solution. For me it wasn't. If you want the convenience of controlling most of the common functions of a lot of equipment and don't mind the limitations, then this expensive remote could be a great addition to your collection. We now have nine remotes instead of the seven that came with the equipment. The old One is still on the charger for my wife's use (she doesn't care for the lack of buttons on the Ultimate). The Ultimate is for me, most of the time. The individual equipment remotes are stashed close-by in case I need to access something I can't find on the Ultimate.If Logitech would update their software to the 21st century (they still have Laserdisc but don't have a proper category for ROKU) and put the touch screen at the top with all of the buttons grouped together, I'd love the Ultimate One. If they don't make changes to the software I won't buy a new One when this One wears out. There Can Be Only One! OK, I stole the review title from the infamous Highlander movie, but I did so because it does apply. The Harmony One, in world of universal remotes, really is the one remote that can replace all of your device remotes, but does so at a seemingly steep price, and with a small investment of time unless you are upgrading from another Logitech remote and your devices are already input into your online Logitech profile.This is my third Logitech remote - I am upgrading from an older model, the 650. The programming software I was using to update my 650 is no longer used by Logitech, nor does it even recognize the Ultimate One. So, despite logging in and repeatedly clicking upgrade remote, the remote could not connect to the Logitech website. I wasted two nights and about two hours trying to solve this problem and finally learned via Google that the One is not compatible with the old software. It would have been nice if this had been noted somewhere on the instructions.I was less than thrilled when I learned I would need to create a new profile and user name rather than simply logging in at the Logitech website with my existing information. Once I did, thankfully it asked if I had an existing account and once I entered my old information, it allowed me to port over all my existing devices. So, I got to where I needed to be but it took longer than it should have.Those of you who have Logitech remotes know that you enter your devices (TV model, DVD player, Home Theater Receiver model, etc) and then the software allows you to set up activities like watching a movie, playing a game. etc., and the software prompts you with questions about which device controls what function. (e.g., which device controls sound and volume, etc.) Once this is all programmed, you update the remote (which is connected to your computer) and off you go. Once this data is entered and configured, the One really shines. It lights up when you pick it up. You can control all your devices of course with just the one remote. You can even stagger power on or off order if you want. It will set your TV and other devices to the correct inputs if they need to be changed between functions.I use an Xbox One to watch my Blu Rays and DVD's. The Xbox controller is a poor TV remote. We like subtitles on when we watch DVD's. I was able to set up a quick one button macro in the Logitech software that walks through the four button presses required on the Xbox One to enable subtitles with a single button press on the Ultimate One. The software allows a high degree of customization that I really appreciate.Of course, this programming ability is part of what drives the high cost of the product. This isn't just a remote. It is really a software driven input device with a touch screen. (I use a combination of the touch screen and my buttons depending on my mood). It lights up when you pick it up, feels good in your hands, and in a feature I really like - it has its own charging cradle. Past versions really ate up batteries. I like returning it to its charging cradle after use because I know where it is when I need it again, and it saves me the cost of replacing batteries.As others have noted, not everyone would consider spending 250 on a remote. Even if you are willing to spend the money, you still need some basic technological prowess to program and fine tune this remote to make it work for you. If you have relatives that still struggle with basic computer tasks or how to program their DVR to record their favorite shows, this is not a product for them. I have family members who could not ever hope to program this remote. It is not a complex task to do so, but for people who struggle with technology, programming this remote could be a formidable task.I have a fairly simple home theater line-up with no line of sight issues, so I can't address using this with a hub. But, if you are sick of juggling remotes on movie night, or want to upgrade an existing Logitech, the One is a great step forward. Avoid like the plague! I would give zero stars if I could. This remote promises great things, but fails miserably to deliver. I purchased two of these remotes, and had to return both of them because neither of them would sync with my computer. I have been a dedicated Harmony user for the past four years (see my glowing review of the Harmony 1100) and have NEVER had so much difficulty setting up a universal remote. The sync would hang without finishing, or wouldn't start up at all, and the setup failed to recognize a couple of my devices even though I was absolutely certain I had entered the correct model numbers. I am considerably tech-savvy, and could understand if this problem had occurred with only one remote... but BOTH!! Never again. Wife hates it!!! Very disappointing. Lists the ability to turn components on. I constantly have to reinstall programing. Family Hates it! Five Stars best remote like it a lot better then the remote that came with the tv Have had several Harmony Remotes. This one is terrible. Everyone in my family hates this new harmony remote. We love our Harmony One up in the kids playroom but the Ultimate is the ultimate disappointment. It is not well balanced in hand. It defaults to screens we don't want on the touch screen. It requires 2 hands since it is so out of balance that touching some of the buttons feels really wonky. Do not buy one of these. A used or refurbed Harmony One would be much better. I think the guys who designed this were too in love with their Android phones and wanted to create a similar feel but it stinks. I fail to find a way to make it start on the screen we want. I've actually had to threaten my kids with punishment if they bring up how much they hate this one. Easy to program Pro: Does it all. Easy to program.Con: Extremely, Highly sensitive touch screen. Shorter battery life than expected, but that may increase over time. No service after the warranty expires Be aware that there is no service on any Harmony unit after the warranty expires. Heres a quote from the answer to my request for service.Unfortunately, Logitech does not offer repair services for out of warranty products, including Harmony remotes, nor can I recommend any repair shops that work on our products.Ian CroweDirector, Customer ExperienceLogitech Harmony Remotes Four Stars SOMEWHAT CLUMSY TO USE Works great Got this to replace an older harmony and it works great. It was very easy to set up since it just took the configuration of my old harmony and used that for the new one. Very Nice Remote that does its job ... almost all the time. Performs as expected ... the vast majority of the time. Sometimes it seems to lose its programing as to a particular function. I don't know if I accidentally hit a wrong button first that threw it off or it just failed. Luckily, each time it failed, I have gone in the drop down menu and selected Fix It which presents a menu of devices. You then select the device that failed and you are provided with various possibilities as to the failure. Let's say you hit the off button and your receiver failed to shut off. You just select your receiver which is automatically listed under Fix It and then select the Power Off button. Each time the receiver shut off and was thereafter fixed until the next mishap which is acceptabely rare. Another consumer caused problem can be that when you hit off you did not aim your remote in the direction of the receiver long enough. So my Ultra High Def Vizio will shut off but my Onkyo receiver may remain on. The macro involved with all combined functions sends separate signals out to each device that had been needed for the function button that was previously used, e.g. Watch TV, Watch Smart Devices, Watch Blue Ray, Listen to FM. In any case, it allows me to keep all my other remotes in a convenient location, in case there is a failure that might require one of them, but the Harmony is the sole remote on my bed. Nice. The best controller I have ever used seen or heard of. Fantastic - it is programmable with a computer MAC or PC. Like how it recognizes all the components - TV, Cable, sound bar, Blu-Ray player. Apple TV. Read the reviews and and made the jump to get this and really glad I did. Lives up to all the platitudes previously rendered. worth the switch from the 1100 had 2 Harmony 1100's (spilt wine on the first), liked them but found fast forwarding a pain, especially when having to time pressing play at the end of adverts, also the display output would keep flipping upside down. Ultimate One fixes that plus several other nice touches. Some complain about the fast forward being at top of remote, I see the point but doesn't bother me enough. hopefully Logitech will continue to invest in their remotes. awesome set up can be a little difficult but you ... Formerly 6 remotes ...now one .... awesomeset up can be a little difficult but you get used to it and fine tune to your liking pretty quickly.shape is a little funny kind of wants to slide out of your hand with all the weight at the bottom and tapered towards the top.whatever, i like it mainly because i cant stand digging through a pile of remotes I have owned a Harmony One for many years and absolutely LOVE it. I did not like the Ultimate One ... Not very functional. I have owned a Harmony One for many years and absolutely LOVE it. I did not like the Ultimate One AT ALL. I ended up paying extra for a new, discontinued Harmony One. On the Ultimate One there are very few hard buttons. Anytime you want to do anything you have to swipe / flip through the screens to get to the section you want then push the soft button. Also, it is too sensitive and you end up pushing something you didn't intend to. They do have a lock feature for the screen but THEN you have to unlock the screen THEN swipe / flip to the screen you need to find the function / feature you want. I'm begging Logitech to focus on making the Harmony One better... they really came up with a winner on that one. Great way to end remote clutter in your family room This product blows me away with how well it manages multiple devices simultaneously. Even my non-technical husband likes it! We were able to replace 5 remotes with this single controller and it operates everything really well. Especially nice is its ability to learn functions from other remotes that you can assign to the empty function buttons. Just remember to pop it into its charger once or twice a week. This gets the job done, but leaves me feeling disappointed. I've been using this remote for about a year now, before that had a harmony one (which I miss, but we finally sat on it too many times and it broke)The good:I can use it to control my Apple TV, Tivo HD, Bluray player and receiver with ease. All the needed buttons seem to be there for with some left over for extra stuff. I've got the 30 sec skip forward and back programmed on the bottom buttons, as well as the Live TV button and cancel button for Tivo.You can setup your favorite channels as icons on the fly and sync them back to your computer.The help feature always seems to work for me when things mess up. The Harmony one often took several steps to correct the power if the TV went to sleep.Recharging dock is nice.It actually replaces all my other remotes.The disappointing:I miss having a hard number buttons. The screen is a poor replacement. You have to swipe several times to get the to software keyboard.The screen doesn't wake up when you move the remove like the Harmony One did. The touchscreen is too slow and doesn't feel responsive compared to a smartphone.The gestures are completely useless for controls.You have to swipe several times to get the to software keyboard.The setup software was a pain in the ass to get going. It used silver lite or some plugin in a browser. It would have been better as a native app. The software menus were confusing and some features seems exclusive when they shouldn't have been. I couldn't program a tivo button and something else. I had to get the tivo remote and program it as a custom button.The button signals are also too slow. I was able to shorten them in the software program, but only for favorite channel buttons. Turning things off from my TV mode takes 15 seconds or so, doesn't sound like much but feels like forever pointing it at the screen.While I could change speed of the favorite buttons punching in the numbers, I couldn't get it fast enough. I think the min time between presses was 200ms or something. I feel like I can punch in the numbers faster on my Tivo remote, if I wanted too. I should be able to make this faster but I couldn't in the software.Overall, if you have the money, get the Harmony remote with the hardware buttons (it cost 2X what this one does). This gets the job done, but leaves me feeling disappointed. Four Stars Allows me to have all electronics in a closet and out of sight. This is the one that was the best for me I tried two other Harmony remotes first, the elite and the ultimate home. This is the one that was the best for me. but I can still say I am mostly happy with this remote I have had this remote for a couple years, but I can still say I am mostly happy with this remote! It is easy enough to program and use you can program special functions (like when you want to play a blueray, it automatically turns on the TV, Blueray player, and surround sound with a single button.There are a couple things that are a pain:-Frequent requests for you to update the remote (I usually ignore them)-The rechargeable battery life is just OK.I do love that I can use my phone since the remote works through your home network though! Horrible Replacement. Go with the Harmony One Logitech sent me this as a replacement due to a swollen battery issue in my Harmony One remote. I thought wow, what great customer service, they sent me a brand new remote with no questions asked. After using it a few times, it's easy to figure out why. 1st the good:-Small / Easy to grip-Easy to set up, especially favorite channelsNow the bad:-The layout is horrible. With buttons at both above and below the touch screen, navigation is very awkward.-There are no numeral buttons on the remote itself. You have to swipe through a few menus on the touchscreen to access them.- You cannot access the battery easily, if you need a replacement.Overall this is an okay remote, but for the price they charge, I would still try to find a Harmony One remote. This older model is easier to use than the Ultimate One. Hopefully Logitech will design a new model to replace this model. Four Stars Not very easy to use but does work on all my devices. Five Stars Like it Says....its Ultimate. excellent remote excellent remote Easy to program Works well and easy to program. I had a harmony 650 before for another room and this is for the theater room with 5 devices. Harmony Ultimate One.. Loved It!! As advertised!! Easy to use and setup on line. No problems with unit operation and quality. I loved the One I never write reviews, but I felt I had to for this remote. I was the owner of a Logitech Harmony One for several years prior to purchasing this remote. I loved the One, it was reliable, easy to use, and felt nice in the hand. I have been using the Ultimate One for well a year now, and for the price this remote falls short.First was the set up. Logitech switched to a new program, so if you were coming over from a previous device you had to start from scratch. I feel that everything should have simply imported to the new program. This added a good amount of time to the set up. The remote itself looks great, and is lightweight. However, it does not feel as ergonomic as the One did. It is also lacking the number buttons, which makes quickly switching between several channels more time consuming than a traditional remote. You have to either scroll through the channels or go through the touch screen to find the channel icon you want.When it comes to functionality the remote really falls short. I purchased the 100 hub to control my PS3. The remote constantly loses its pairing with the system. I am them forced to get the PS3 controller and re-register the blu tooth device all over again. It defeats the entire purpose of the remote. It is also not uncommon for the remote and HUB itself to lose their pairing. Forcing you to either restart the HUB or connect the remote to a computer and reset it.The remote also has not had the ability to connect to a PS4 until recently, and it still can not turn the system on/off. If I still need to go to the system or use my PS remote, what is the use of the universal remote The remote also seems to incorrectly perform the start up or shut down of a process more frequently than my One did. Making me either press the help button, go into the devices and fix it myself, or physically get up and turn a component on of off.I would have given my One five stars to give you an idea of the step back this remote is. For the 350 I paid when it was new (including the HUB), this is a real let down.***Update 4/29/16***Somehow this remote has become even less functional. As noted above there is no easy way to change the channel with this remote. The icons are now completely useless. For example if I want to change to channel 44.1 I press the icon button because I do not want to scroll through 20 channels, and the on screen numbers do not work well. The first press will get me 4.1. Next 1, then 4.1, then .1, then 44. Finally I'm at a channel that I can just scroll to. Sometimes it never even gets close and I will just scroll through all the channels. I make sure to keep the remote pointed directly at the TV, and give it time between button presses but nothing works. I am changing my review to one star. Five Stars Outstanding worth the price if you have a lot of equipment Four Stars Would be perfect if the number buttons on the screen were more responsive Aside from that this is a very nice remote. I wish the software was less wizard-y My second Harmony remote. I would prefer a real numeric keypad vs the on-screen one. Aside from that this is a very nice remote. I wish the software was less wizard-y. Had a hard time setting up the favorite channels. I bought a 650 for half the ... The set-up software was buggy. Had a hard time setting up the favorite channels. I bought a 650 for half the price that works just as well as my old Harmony One. Good but compared to older models, it is annoying This is my 3rd Harmony remote, I bought it because my last Harmony One had a broken display after using it for 4 years. Therefore my review is based on the comparison of the last 2 remotes I used.First thing I noticed is that this remote is lighter than the other ones. Also, in order to upload the configuration I needed to download the new MyHarmony software, instead the older software. The good thing is that I was able to migrate all the configuration from my Harmony One. However, after the migration, not all configuration was perfectly in place, for example, some of the buttons were not working, or not there anymore, so I needed to manually configure them again (not perfect).This remote is based on its touchscreen display, I am trying to get used to it, since my Harmony One had more 'analog' buttons. This one of the disavantages (I think): I was used to feel the buttons and never look at them when I needed to press anything. With this remote I need to look at the display every time I need to change channels. However you can include your favorite channels as your main screen, which makes sense since I noticed I usually watch a half dozen channels.If you are a newbie with a Harmony remote you may find some difficulties with programming, but since I have already owned a previous model, I think it is a very good remote, but a little worse than older models. Three Stars Its a little glitchy at times A Complete Waste of Time and Money This is the worst product I've ever bought. I have two different computers: one Windows, and the other a Mac. Both have the compatible operating systems with which to set up this remote. Unfortunately even after spending well over an hour with a Logitech support person I was unable to get into the set up page. on either computer. The Logitech web site is ambiguous and extremely un-user friendly. I'm good with computers and have never had an issue with any other device, but this one is simply poorly designed, with poor software, and even though the support person was trying, they simply had no clue either. Save your money, and buy a non Logitech universal remote, and will save the unbelievable headaches of this compete waste of money. Like it so far Like it so far. This is a replacement for my old Logitech 1100 that I had for years. Still getting use to it, but does everything that I need it to do. I find it hard to handle and use, the ... I find it hard to handle and use, the programmed channels never work with out trying 6 times, even when using the numbers screen you have to try sometimes 3 or 4 times before you get the channel you want. Great Features and programming, but difficult to manipulate. The ease of programming, setting up components and accessing them is super. However, Some often used functions are at the bottom of the remote and two hands are needed to press the buttons. Also we have experienced trying to hit one button and actually brush another resulting in the wrong selection. But we'll probably get used to doing it right. Great remote- but doesn't support Hubs. I bought this hoping to replace one that looks just like it but also supports communicating with the home control hub. Unfortunately, this one doesn't support that feature, only its own standalone IR features. While not a deal breaker for me, don't make the same mistake if you're looking to replace a dead remote that you use with the wifi home control hubs. Great all in one remote Was looking for a new family room remote to control tv,tivo,yamaha tuner, blueray player and apple tv all with the push of a single button.The Logitech - Harmony Ultimate One did all this and has room for more. Great Price I bought this remote based on a sale price, and I wanted to reduce the remotes cluttering my desk. It was easy to program but I am still learning how to use itMy cable provider was not provided in the Program List so I had to add my favorite channels manually and upload the icons myself . As a surprise bonus I was able to load a fun Icon. The Icon I chose for CNN is ""CNN FAKE News"" That alone was worth the price of the Remote Great Budget Harmony Remote Got this for my dad for his birthday, Hardest part is having to get all the model numbers of your electronics. Super useful and it's great to be able to recharge instead of replace batteries. Amazing universal remote Amazing works better than I expected, I was looking for something that would be simple when I needed simple and would work for all my devices. convenient but somewhat confusing this remote makes it convenient to have everything controlled with just the one remote - however, it's a little confusing but we are still getting used to it Awesome !! It was hard to figure out how to do all the program setup but once I figured it out and use one remote instead of 5 remote it's so much easier but sometime pain in the butt great remote... I love it Awesome remote. Easy to set up and use. It's very intuitive and customizable. Great sound system Great sound system… Would definitely recommend…... Works well, few physical buttons Bought this to replace a broken Harmony One remote. The new My Harmony application works better than the Harmony website. You can store multiple remotes in the application. Remote has fewer hard buttons, but double functions for those, momentary, and hold. Battery life is more like 4 days over the prior 7 days. Has gesture controls on separate screen for thing like changing channels and volume. You define activities such as Watch TV or play Xbox, then program the tethered remote with the new instructions. Some corrections can be made on the remote itself. Hard to setup but works It's a pain to setup. Logitech has professionals that will do it for you for free but they are slow.Once it's setup the only downfall is line of sight. Needs perfect LOS to all the devices it accesses which is a potentially huge problem if your receiver is on the left and the TV is on the right or something worse. Everything Great-One problem. Works like a dream. The problem seems to be that you now need to download the installation program from the Website. I only needed to transfer my current settings onto a new replacement remote. However hard I tried, I could not get the settings to transfer. But, it finally did download and is fine. Great remote Once you get used to where the buttons are this remote is one of the best I've used. Great Remote Works very well . Very easy to program especailly if you already have aHarmony remote . Just copy the settings from the Harmony website.Very happy with the remote. great remote this remote replaced an older model and i was able to get all our accesories on one unit rather then many remotes Slow and does not support RF like they advertise I was looking to replace my Harmony One with something more up to date and this was my choice. I chose this because of my One but this was a bad choice. First of all it was advertised as being able to control the PS3 and Xbox One via RF. This was not the case. The remote will not do RF at all. It is slow, feels clunky, and has HORRIBLE battery life. I was barely able to get 3 days out of a charge where my One can go for almost a month. Over all, to me, this is a huge step backwards from the Harmony One. Avoid this unless you have no other options. Fantastic and Easy Pull it out of the box, go to the web sight, enter the make and model of components, and the remote programs itself. Works instantly! I was able to put 5 remotes in the drawer. What's better? Anyone can pick up the remote and watch cable, a dvd, or Netflix with a push of a button.... Simple, Elegant, a Great Improvement for Logitech Purchased for my wife, who hates all things tech...setup was easy, operation is intuitive, interface is robust and elegant...a most excellent purchase! Breeze to use Everyone in the house loves it. Was breeze to setup, transferred settings from old remote. Remote saves time Harmony Ultimate One Universal remote controls multiple units attached to the Samsung 4K TV. Easy on/off buttons control TV, Receiver, and Blu-ray player all at once. Only concern is that the touch screen channel numbers must be precisely hit to change channels. Almost alwayshave to use two hands. Great Remote For Anyone What a great product. Easy to set up and use. Definitely would recommend to anyone. Full featured remote The remote features are very good. Nice lighted hey board and every device I needed was supported by Logitech. A lot of thought has gone into the layout. I would have given five stars except not having a physical page down/up button is a bit of a drag. You have to use the virtual one buried on the third page of features. One other reason 4 stars not five is because the battery life isn't stellar. Good Harmony remote I purchased this as an upgrade to the Harmony One that I had. Over time the Harmony Ones keys were starting to stick (common fate when you have kids even older ones like mine). This was a great upgrade. This remote charges vertically which reduces the amount of space it needs on my couch side table. Plus we can add all our favorite channels and the remote shows the channel logos right on the screen.Setting it up was a breeze. Supply the model numbers of the devices and it all works as I wanted the very first time. A good universal remote I love this remote. I was using my smartphone with the My Harmony app and Hub to control my devices, which worked great. I just didn't like the impact the app had on my phone's battery, but this remote solved that problem for me. Fantastic Remote I wanted a remote that could handle all of my electronics and this one fits the bill. It handles all the equipment. It is easy to use and has a help button that will trouble shoot any issues (I have not had any). I could not be happier with this remote. Much better feel than my old Harmony Touch I already own the Harmony Touch for almost 2 years and although the Ultimate looks identical to the old Touch, the feel of the Ultimate is much better. The Ultimate feels slightly heavier, sturdier, the back of remote is textured so holding it feels more secured. I also love that you get a slight vibrating feedback whenever you touch the screen or buttons. This is my third Harmony remote with the first being the Harmony 880. The MyHarmony software is easy too work with when configuring the remote. The $200 on sale price is a big pill to swallow for a remote but convenience is priceless. This is a great remote This is a great remote to get if you want to eliminate the clutter and steps of using multiple remotes. One remote Finally we have only one remote instead of 5! This remote is very easy to use. Love it! The one to rule them all The harmony remote does control all of my devices. It's a bit sluggish on the remote interface but all in all it does what you need it do. If you want to stop using all your remotes do yourself a favor & pick one up. Yes and Sale person recommend this one I like this product, but wish I went with the one with voice command Hmmm it is going to take patients. When it works it works great. I've had the older model time to upgrade. Older one worked great still trying to get this one working all the time. It just going to take time to get it all figured out. I would recommend it if you like a small challenge. You might get it in one sitting. Great remote. It took me about two weeks to finally get used to the remote and I love it. Don't get discouraged at first. Take your time to set it up and get used to all the features. Good buy. Different than regular remotes... WE were tired of having 5 romotes laying around. Our Best Buy Guy suggested this Harmony remote. Geek squad set it up for us when they delivered our tv and blu-ray. I'm a Mac person, so it seemed pretty user friendly to me with it's menus. My husband is not really a Mac person, so it took just a little bit, but I think he finds it's user friendly. Have to put it in the stand to recharge when it gets low...not used to that. Sensitive remote We found this remote difficult to use because it is so sensitive. It took several tries to enter three digits for a TV station, because it wanted to go to the station represented by the first or second digit. Also, it won't""talk"" to our Bose sound system, so we had to use the Bose remote and this one...so it wasn't very universal. In short, we returned it in frustration. Easy to use This remote is the best purchase I have made. It's ease of use, and I don't have to have 5 remote controls anymore! Great remote control! We purchased this remote to enable us to manage several items: TV, DVR, Blue-ray player, XM radio, and multi-CD player. This eliminated many remotes!! It works like a charm. Great Product for the price Remote was easy to set up and worked exactly as designed. I did need some help with the technical department in setting up the sequence of when the TV, Cable box, blue ray, etc came on. Tech was very knowledgeable and walked me thru the issue and the fix. Very happy Really like this remote This replaced an older harmony remote that we were very happy with but which was dying. Generally love the form factor on the harmony ultimate one and it feels great in the hand. It contols my tv, av receiver and blu-ray player without any issue (after some tweaking). My biggest complaint is that I don't like having the control buttons above the screen. Otherwise, it was easy to set up and it has passed the wife test (wife generally hates any new technology I bring into the house). Excellent remote but not enough I am a long time user of Logitech remotes. I purchased this to replace my previous one. Unfortunately, this did not provide RF capability and so I upgraded it to a Harmony Elite which I believe is a better remote for the money. Best Remote Ever Very easy to program. Controls all your gadgets. This is the best remote ever. You can personalize it with pictures and phrases. Easy to use anyone can use this. Very nice remote Overall the remote is great! Just wish the battery life was a little better. We mainly use it in the evening for a few hours and after 2 days it is dead. Amazing The setup is what blew me away. You charge it, turn it on, plug it into computer, select your devices save settings and done! It took 30 min to sync and create an entire list of devices and quick key settings to do specific tasks!Its great! great remote This remote handles all of my needs. Upgraded from the 700. Not as Good as Original Harmony One This remote is decent, but not as good as the Original One. The button layout is not well thought out. The FF button is at the top above the touch screen. When ever I am using the remote to control my DVR and I fast forward through commercials, my hand hits the touch screen and changes the channel. The work around for this is to scroll off the Favorites screen, bit it's still very annoying. Great Easy to use once you get used to time out on entering channel. Set up by Rick at Geek Squad Mekbourne Fl to many screens just ot change channels Not a good product. Takes to long in just making channels changes. Great One control makes my total system much easier to use. Perfect remote. Great remote. Logitech hits it out of the park. Works with all my devices. Battery could stand to last longer on a charge. Had to replace older model. Newer more high tech than the last one. Geek squad programmed. Works as advertised This one replaced an aged Logitech that was probably 7 or 8 years old. We liked the idea of a charging station instead of a cord hanging out of the wall that the old one used. The display is great. The touch screen is easy to see and works as it should. My only regret is that you still have to point and shoot. Otherwise, it's great. Try to get it on sale. BB has often advertises it on their website as an afternoon GET IT sale! it works almost everything in my house works almost every thing in my house............... Combine all remotes Great way to combine all remotes in the house. Have very easy setup via computer. Awesome remote for multiple devices I have multiple brands of AV equipment, and this remote is very easy to program. It links the correct pieces for the desired activity. I highly recommend this remote. Easy to navigate! After the basic setup, which was simple enough, the remote works great and controls all the devices I need. Makes me feel more organized! Great remote This is my 2nd Harmony remote. For some reason I had trouble programming and it still will not work with my Samsung DVR box from Optimim. I will have to manually teach it commands. What a pain! Love it I have two of these remotes. I love having all my devices controlled with on one remote. Frustrating Junk Controlling three devices simultaneously; TV, Cable Box, & Bose Audio. Frequently fails to turn on the cable box or audio device; help works to turn on the failed device, but requires more steps than necessary. Charter Cable digital stations are all three digit selections, the Harmony frequently fails to send all three numbers and may send one or two resulting in an unwanted selection. All this from about 8 feet away from the receiver. Save your money unless you enjoy frustration. Great Remote Really love this remote as I can now use one remote to control everything. Takes a while to program everything at first but once you have everything programmed it is great. Sometimes annoying that you have to be pointing it directly at the tv or cable box so it will pick up the signal of what you are trying to do. Overall it is a great control! Only remote to have I have several Logitech Harmony remotes...880, One, and Ultimate One. The Ultimate One is very easy to program, though I have not set it up for smart TV web surfacing or movie streaming, I at least have instruction on how to do. Pretty much connect to your computer and Logitech website, enter your makes and models of equipment, update the remote and your are done. Logitech had made one big improvement in their website for remotes, in that you can now have multiple remotes in one account, copy all settings for one and program another, etc. Takes the pain out of programming a remote. Highly recommend. I would say that I have a basket of remotes being unused...but guess who get to hold the Harmony? The wife...I get stuck with others....Hey, why don't I just buy another one? Just what I needed! Couldn't be happier! Going from 7 remotes, now, just 1. Should have made this investment long ago.... great remote I enjoy this remote, once you get use to learning how to change between option to control the unit you are using. It is amazing at how it learns every control that my electronic has on the original remote. It is not for beginners as it can be frustrating if you are not that savvy with electronics. However if you are it is a wonderful remote and it does learn and can control all of you electronics in your home.I have all my TV's, all my Blu-ray, sound bars, receivers, it will control any electric you add to this device.I do recommend this product. good looking remote control looks good but has some issues over price,will not work with Bluetooth device's also they made it way to complicated to program device's Great Remote The Harmony is my go to remote, I've set this remote up for myself and others. The harmony is very easy to setup, specially if you are just doing basic activities. For regular users the only time I would recommend help with installation is if you want second zones, special buttons, etc programmed into the remote. Remote The Harmony Remote is handy to use if the hole operation would be explained at a slower instruction. Great Nephew showed proper usage. Like the older model better, Like the older model better, this model I have to have the doors opened. Screen is very sensitive..wish there was a better alternative. excellent very easy to operate and fancy too. my little computer Great remote Bought this for my husband he was using 4 remotes. He loves it. Love it I love Harmony remotes. I hate having to use several remotes to watch TV or a movie and this takes care of that. Easy to program. Love it Really easy to program. Easy to use. kid friendly. Nice remote I like the remote. It does not have to be pointed directly at the TV/DVR/Blu-ray to operate. I even went upstairs and tried it there to see, and it still worked. Several options available. The only downside is the TV channel number buttons don't always work properly, but I was able to set up the stations I want to watch so it's not been that big a problem. Logitech's great standard Replaced a 9 series remote and I got the same functionality with less buttons - family now sold on itI have linked it to a hub as wellI was concerned looking at it that I was going to loose options but all is well in a better designed packageTo Logitech The speed of your website is slow especially start up/ logging in The issue is not my internet speed. Consequently it took some time to set up Very sensitive. Controls are overly sensitive and small. Prefer Sony remote supplied with the TV. Great remote I love the latest edition of the harmony remotes! The layout of the buttons is eprgonominaly good. You can do so much with the touch screen. I just started experimenting with the color buttons on the bottom and what they do! Nice surprises! I highly recommend this remote to anyone considering. Great remote Great remote and programs easy with a computer. One remote to do everything.. Wife loves this !!! Thanks Does more than I need but there is some fumbling t Does more than I need but it's touch screen is a temperamental thing. Sleek, but not as sexy as previous models This remote looks good, obviously not as good as some of the previous models, but it'll do. Works as it should. The ""Help"" button isn't as easy to find as on my last Harmony, and I'm not really a fan of the ""hold for skip"" double function of the ff button. Got it for a great price, though. I really like this remote. I recommend this remote to anyone looking to combine all their electronics with one remote. SUPER EASY TO PROGRAM -- great, smart remote I was one of those people who said that I would never pay for a universal remote, especially one over $50. I mean, how lazy must you be not to be able to use the remotes that came with your devices -- right? That was until I was hunting for my missing Roku remote and, in the process, discovered that I had 13 remotes in my 2-bedroom apartment. Between the streaming device remotes, the TVs, the gaming stations, the blu-ray player and soundbar, my coffee tables and night stand were cluttered with remotes. That's the time that I started thinking -- just thinking -- about a universal remote. When I saw that Logitech's One remote was for sale (for 50% off) I decided to jump on the opportunity. I was intimidated at first, but Logitech's software was SO EASY to use. I simply entered the model numbers of my devices and Logitech worked through the rest of the programming and automatically worked out the combo functions like turning on the TV and soundbar, changing the TV input and turning on the gaming console when I want to play Xbox. It works flawlessly! Now I carry around one remote to control all the audio/video components in my apartment. This remote is okay but that's about it. I'm having trouble turning my Wii game system on. It doesn't say Wii, it says X-Box. Then again, I'm a dinosaur and it could be me with the problem. Very good remote!!! This is a really good remote. Would be perfect if the touch screen was at the top instead of in the middle of the remote. Overly sensitive Too easy for you to barely touch it and something totally different appears. If you don't touch it just right, you never know what you will see. And you can't leave it on the charger, so if you run your charge down, the remote is inoperable. A charge only lasts 3 days. Battery operated would be better. My husband calls it garbage. One to rule them all Easy to use and control everything in your home. somethings you will need the hub. Great gift Love this product. Great gift. Endless fun if you're a gadget lover. EXCELLENT PRODUCT Synced right up to my equipment. Works Great! Has trouble connecting every now and then but with the fix it now button it fixes the issue right away. Vary good product Vary easy to program , love the recharge option place charging stand when trough for the night always ready the next day, pair well with all my devices Good remote Overall this is a good remote. The IR transmitter is very strong. But it's easy to hit the wrong button on the touch screen. I don't like that the off button is so close to rewind as well. Super easy to use for all the family I was nervous about my dad and girlfriend using this remote. But its played out and worked well. The battery dies pretty quick when its left on the bed because it lights up every time someone moves. But I'm happy with the remote purchase. Good universal remote for the price. Good remote overall. Must use computer with internet connection to program. Poor battery life between charges. Just Ok.. It's a great device if you have multiple devices; however, I don't like that you have to switch devices to turn the volume up or down for the television. Logtech is a excellent brand I had another remote same brand so i decided to try one of their high end remotes.....we love it Effective replacement As universal remotes go, this one is relatively effective and easy to use. Like a lot of universal remotes, getting to certain equipment specific features to do any AV equipment ""tinkering"" can be a little cumbersome. But at least it's possible using the universal remotes extensive digital menus without having to grab the original OEM remotes. For normal everyday use, it's quite convenient for setups that might include the combination of an AV receiver, cable/satellite box, streaming box, Blu-ray, TV or more. No need to have multiple remotes laying around to control primary functions of the peripherals. And for the most part, I rarely have to dig out one of the equipment specific remotes. But I'd probably keep them available (maybe in a drawer or cabinet nearby) if you like to tinker often with equipment specific settings, although it's not absolutely necessary. With a little patience scrolling through the remote digital menu, you'll find just about any function the OEM remotes can perform, and sometimes even more. Works great, but a little ""buggy"" I purchased the Harmony Smart Control (hub + remote) when it was on sale, and loved NOT having the touchscreen. The problem with this setup for me though, was it did not have the IR built into the remote, which I needed for my TV (too far away from hub or IR blasters). I ended up purchasing this remote, which is much more deluxe, but I personally like having the numerical buttons available at all times and find that whatever is on the screen is not what I want on the screen. I'm sure I'll get it all setup the way I wanted, but so far, my wife has had issues using it. She's not great with electronics, but she's been ""stuck"" when things freeze up or are not working correctly. Always wanted one of these Great remote very easy to program. It controls everything Powerful Remote I found the Logitech Harmony One to offer excellent screen readability and easy to add new functions on the down loaded app. The signal is strong and dependable. The activity screen is somewhat difficult for me to scroll without activating a function that I am not interested in. I think there should be a right hand scrolling bar like web sites. Otherwise, I am satisfied with my purchase. It is pretty good Bought it to replace an old harmony. Paired it with my harmony hub. It's good but the price is a little you high for what it delivers. Awesome This remote was so easy to set up. And once set up the response time is so much better than my older harmony remote and a little more forgiving on pointing it at my entertainment center. It's a solid buy when on sale. Overpriced The remote work when it wanted to. It would turn things on when it wasn't supposed to and it was awkward to hold. Good remote We had a Logitech 1100 before this one and we loved it so when I stopped working we knew we had to get this one Works fine Took some ""Tweeking"" but we have 5 things running off of it. Geek Squad did a fine job installing it. Overall a great remote but have my reservations The remote was not a smooth install for me to pair up with my existing Hub to replace the remote I had which died after a year. The battery life is shorter than expected and the touch screen can be over sensitive, but it does exactly what I expected it to do. I am holding out on one extra star due to past experience with Logitech hub remote for quality, let's see how long this will last before it breaks, if it doesn't last at least 10 years then it is garbage to me. Good but not great Really like the fact that i can control all the devices in my entertainment area, but with one caveat. The controller has issues with my sound bar and occasionally cannot either power it on or off. A friend of mine purchased one with me and is reporting similar issues with their sound bar. Very convenient Easy to see display, helps with clutter only one remote on the table Great product. This is a great remote with lots of features. Easy to install and easy to use. Setting it up was quick and easy. Love-Hate Does everything it's supposed to but touch screen has an irritating delay when first using the screen Uggggh! Programmed it myself, didn't work. Had Geek Squad out twice ... still doesn't work. A waste of $250. Less This product does it all. I only need the one remote no more clutter on my tv stand. Luv this product. Good remote with sensitive touch controls Handles a wide variety of device combinations. Touch screen controls may be accidentally selected (use locking feature to minimize bad effects). It is wise to include all available devices in each selection to allow continued operations on one device when switching to view another. Great remote Works well with the tv an cable box. I love the ability to store favorite channels with the remote. Disappointing I purchased this to replace my beloved harmony one. This can't hold a candle to the harmony one. It's curved bottom prevents it from resting flatly on a table. It is so sensitive I can't pick it up without triggering some random function. It is uncomfortable to hold and quite difficult to operate. Overall, a big disappointment. Does anyone have a harmony one they want to sell? Works Great Once programmed, this remote is fantastic. Only click once and the tv turns on and goes to the desired channel. ! Once you program the remote it will do everything you want and the best part is that you can control all your a/v equipment with just one control.Best remote I have ever owned. Hard to set up I read reviews on this remote, however, it was hard to use with my Sonos sound system and Samsung 65"" tvVery confusing, better off with a much more simple all in one remote Life changer Works great with all my products.Little bit of a lag, but not an issue for me. Great universal remote Consilidated 5 remotes into one and we live it! So much easier. I do not know why I didn't do it sooner This is an amazing device that operates 5 devices in my case and works flawlessly. I could not be happier to get rid of the pile of remotes! Works with any model TV Setting up this remote to my Pioneer ELITE was easy as 123. Simply elegant Simple lay out. Totally customizable. Bought one, after while gave set up to my folks. They love it. Bought this older simpler remote again because I love the button simplicity. Not a huge fan We wanted an all in one remote to use for all of our devices. My husband did the research which showed this one to be the best. After using it for 6 months we completely disagree. The ergonomics of the remote aren't right, the screen on it gets touched accidentally all the time causing problems, and its difficult to switch from one device to another. Would return it if we could. After paying that much for a stupid remote we will have to think long and hard about wasting that much money on another one. Awesome Remote I have never written a review before, but this remote deserves one. We had four remotes to watch TV or watch a movie . And now just one. It is AWESOME. I was worried the set up would be complicated or not work. However Harmony's web site was very easy to follow and simply walks you through the whole set up step by step. It walks you through the set up of activities and your favorite TV Channels. If I can do it anyone can!I was so impressed that it motivated me to write this review.I would highly recommend this remote!!! Great Device! I purchased the Harmony Ultimate One to replace my aging Harmony 1100. I like the one handed form factor of the Ultimate One, the ease of set up and use. One remote to control all of your home theater devices. The battery typically lasts me 2-3 days. For some reason I remember my Harmony 1100 lasting me a bit longer than that, but it is not a deal breaker. I just needed to train myself to remember to drop it on the charger more frequently. I chose the Ultimate One over the more expensive Harmony Ultimate because I do not have any of my devices hidden in cabinets that would require the IR blasters or the Harmony Hub. Very easy remote to use Excellant remote, and is easy to use, and the geek squad easily set it up to my Smart TV. Fantastic Product--totally delivered I've been waiting 4 years for my home theater set up. Adding this Harmony remote totally accentuates everything about it. I love it and my partner, who is technology challenged, finds it easy to use as well. It's easy to program and when you add the app on our iPhones, it just couldn't be simpler. Bravo to Logitech for a great product that I will enjoy for years! Great product, extremely easy to use The Logitech universal remote was a breeze to program with my 6 elements and is very easy to use and has great performance. Strongly recommend this universal control! Great all-in-one remote. Able to hide all components in one cabinet and control them with one remote. Remote needed for anyone with multiple. This remote does wonders and easy to use. I recommend anyone to get geek squad to set it up. Too confusing for me. Great multi-component remote Overall a great remote. Only drawback I have seen is that some of the functions are now handled through the screen which makes them a little less easy to use. Everything else works great. Remote for all TV needs I love my remote!! It syncs with my surround sound receiver, tv, dvd player, vcr, wii, crome cast, song stream and cable box to day the least. One touch of the button and remote turns on all required equipment. Love have one remote, instead of 6 !!! Smaller and easier to use then the last generation I had an older version that stopped working. I use it to control several components. This upgraded model is easier to use. Great unit but NOT FOR PS3!!! unit is simply amazing but will NOT work with PS3 unless you buy a hub with it. Hassle I had an earlier version of this model. Two things about it were too big of a hassle.1. It was very easy to accidentally have duplicate buttons on the screen for the same device. I think I spent more time with it plugged into the computer than I spent actually using it.2. You know how you can eventually learn where the buttons on a remote are, and you don't have to look at it? You just kind of feel for the buttons? You can't do that with this thing because the buttons on the screen keep changing position.Also, while the battery is charging, you have to use the old remotes anyway. Very easy to use I found this remote to be very simple to set up and it worked right away with no problems. I kind of wish that the play, fast forward, rewind (etc) buttons were on the bottom instead of the top as I seem to activate the touch screen a lot. But, just a minor complain. Highly recommend and it works with every device every time. Great Remote This is a replacement of my Logitech Harmony one, which I loved. Still getting used to the differences, but love it. Easy to use after the Geek Squad set it up Definitely get the Geek Squad to set this up!! Well worth the $99. for set up. Now we can flip between audio and video devices with a push of one button. Very easy to use Screen is way too sensitive and gets locked up The touch screen is way too sensitive and you can easily lock up the entire remote. If you try cleaning the screen in a room separate from the items you control it senses an operation and since it does not get a response back from the devices locks up. Have had to reset the control to fctory settings several times in order for it to function period. Great product We love this product. I bought a Samsung TV floor model and it was missing remote. I was told that this remote would work like the Samsung remote and let me tell you it is the best. Highly recommend it. Mehhh Really disappointed after loving previous models like the Harmony One. Doesn't hold a charge very long, will stop sending out signals for no apparent reason, and the software seems more buggy than earlier versions. Amazing remote for whole system Best all around remote to control my entire system Great for interactive control of several devices I had my old harmony for 8 years and it was super, but the graphics faded and I could not control my devices, I tried the lesser expensive harmony that works with the iPhone, but could not program it correctly, so I bought this model and it's great. Easy to program and works like a charm. The best universal controler Our last remove was also a Harmony. The only way to go. Our other one had the bottom worn off. It was time, even though it's pricy, worth every penny! Great Remote This remote handles all my needs that combine all my remotes in one and is easy to use for a beginner. Great remote Great remote, controls multiple devices, activity based, and easy to program Awesome remote Easy to program and use. Excellent range. Much improved over the earlier models. I think Logitech took a step backwards with this This is my third Logitech Harmony remote. I don't care for the design of this one compared to previous models. Eliminate the number pad on a remote ? really?? Favorites are a very nice feature, but don't replace the need for a number pad and I don't care for the one offered on the touch screen. (my husband HATES it). Setup was tough since I already had the 'software' installed on my laptop and the the packinging/instructions did not make it clear that you needed to download and install NEW software from a different vendor. Took a phone call to support to get it cleared up. I find it very odd (and a poor design decision) that you can't manage all of the features from the software. Some things you have to do on the remote..some things in the software. CONFUSING! All in all - I just don't care for this release which is a shame because I have loved this line of removtes. Once I got the proper software installed - setup was easy and straightforward as I have come to expect from Logitech. The remote has been mostly reliable and has mostly worked properly. I wish I had a new purchase my old Harmony One... Great remote nice to have one instead of trying to use multiples. Poor design The bad: It's a two handed remote. By that I mean that you have to hold it in your hand to use it. You can't just leave it on the end table or other surface and reach over and push a button on it because the bottom is rounded. Another design flub is that the transport keys are located above the touch screen ! If you want to push play, rewind, pause etc., and you brush your hand across the touch screen before it times out you'll change the channel, or something else. Very irritating!! The good: It's very easy to program, and the charging cradle it a winner !"
